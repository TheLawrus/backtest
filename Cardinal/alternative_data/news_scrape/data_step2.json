        "text": " (Bloomberg) -- Demand for haven assets remained in abeyance as the trading week began in Asia with the US and its allies attempting to contain the Israel-Hamas war. The New Zealand dollar advanced after voters elected a new government. Most Read from Bloomberg Israel Latest: Army Says Over 600,000 Gazans Have Fled South US Pushes Bid to Avert Wider Israel War After Iran Warning Israel Latest: Biden and Abbas Talk as Gaza Invasion Nears Your Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas War Global Markets Stable as US Pushes to Contain Middle East War The prospect of wild price swings continued to dog investors though, after Friday\u2019s surges in crude oil, gold and the Swiss franc vs the euro. The US dollar and Japan\u2019s yen \u2014 other traditional refuges in times of turmoil \u2014 remain subdued, along with risk-sensitive currencies including the Australian dollar. The US government bond market, also a haven asset, had a tumultuous week in which bonds whipsawed between the biggest gains and losses in years as demand was offset by troubling inflation data and poor results for several auctions. Israel\u2019s main share index, the TA-35, resumed its decline on Sunday. \u201cThe escalation of the conflict in the Middle East looks set to dominate markets,\u201d Klaus Baader, global chief economist at Societe Generale, said in a note. Other developments affecting exchange rates in early trading included weekend elections in New Zealand and Poland. The New Zealand dollar gained after the center-right National Party was elected for form a government, replacing the Labour Party\u2019s. Poland\u2019s zloty gained against the euro after an exit poll showed the pro-European Union opposition parties appeared likely to take a majority. The Israeli army has said it\u2019s making preparations for \u201csignificant ground operations\u201d in Gaza. Meanwhile, the US has held back-channel talks with Iran in recent days to warn the country against escalating the conflict. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will make a second stop in Israel on Monday after crisscrossing the Middle East with stops in Jordan, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. A wider war in the Middle East risks tipping the world economy into recession, according to Bloomberg Economics. That\u2019s added another concern to investors\u2019 growing list of worries around whether the Federal Reserve has finished raising interest rates and how a rudderless US Congress can avert a government shutdown. A worsening macro environment, combined with sharp swings in interest rates, has \u201cset the stage\u201d for global volatility to pick up, said Ed Al-Hussainy, global rates strategist at Columbia Threadneedle. Global investors are closely watching whether the Israel-Hamas war spills over into the rest of the region, but \u2014 for now \u2014 currency traders remain more focused on the Fed, he said. While broader gauges of market volatility remain subdued, the Swiss currency has surged to the highest in more than a year against the euro, and the US dollar advanced for a fourth week. Volatility in S&P 500 stocks has also increased. There\u2019s plenty of uncertainty in the US to spur further market fluctuations. Last week, a hot inflation report boosted bets on another rate increase from the Fed, superseding haven flows in the hours that followed and spurring the biggest one-day selloff for 30-year bonds since the onset of the pandemic. A gauge of anticipated price swings in the world\u2019s largest Treasury ETF exceed those of the biggest stock fund this month by the most since at least 2005, when the data compiled by Bloomberg begin. Plus, the US House of Representatives remains without a leader. Republicans have nominated Jim Jordan \u2014 who has been endorsed by former President Donald Trump \u2014 but he faces serious challenges to winning the speakership as more moderate lawmakers in the party worry about his hardline stances. But conflict in the Middle East remains the biggest wildcard for investors to digest. \u201cWe\u2019re all on tenterhooks wondering which direction this is going to go, but until we become really concerned about oil supply, the market is going to wait with bated breath,\u201d said Jane Foley, head of currency strategy at Rabobank.

        "text": " TORONTO (AP) \u2014 Canadian autoworkers have voted to ratify a three-year contract agreement with General Motors. Members of Unifor, the union representing about 4,300 Canadian workers at three Ontario GM facilities, voted 80.5% in favor of the deal, the union said Sunday in a statement. The vote followed the pattern of an agreement reached earlier with Ford, and it leaves only Jeep maker Stellantis without a contract. Talks have yet to start with Stellantis, which has the largest Canadian manufacturing footprint of Detroit's three automakers. The GM agreement came after a brief strike last week by the workers at GM factories in Oshawa and St. Catharines, Ontario, and a parts warehouse in Woodstock, Ontario. GM says in a statement that the deal recognizes worker contributions while positioning the company to be competitive in the future. Unifor said that the deal includes pay raises of nearly 20% for production workers and 25% for skilled trades. Workers would get 10% in general pay raises in the first year, with 2% in the second and 3% in the third. The company also agreed to restore cost-of-living pay raises starting in December of 2024. Temporary workers would get pay raises, and those with at least one year of service would get permanent jobs. Workers who get defined-contribution retirement plans will move to a new defined-benefits pension on Jan. 1, 2025. Unifor is Canada\u2019s largest in the private sector union, with 315,000 workers in many industries. In the United States, strikes continue by the United Auto Workers union with nearly 34,000 workers off their jobs at all three Detroit companies."

        "text": " By Dietrich Knauth and Nate Raymond Oct 15 (Reuters) - U.S. bankruptcy Judge David Jones in Houston has resigned after a federal appeals court opened an ethics probe spurred by a previously undisclosed romantic relationship with an attorney whose firm had cases before his court, ending his tenure as the busiest bankruptcy judge in the U.S. Chief U.S. District Judge Randy Crane of the Southern District of Texas told Reuters on Sunday that Jones resigned, effective Nov. 15. Jones had already stepped back from overseeing large bankruptcy cases and began reassigning them to two other judges on the court. Neither Jones nor his courtroom deputy immediately responded to requests for comment. The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a formal misconduct complaint against Jones on Friday, after the judge revealed he has been in a years-long romantic relationship and shared a home with bankruptcy attorney Elizabeth Freeman. Until December 2022, Freeman had been a partner at Jackson Walker, a local law firm that filed many cases in Jones' Houston courthouse. The 5th Circuit said Jones had kept information about his personal relationship from two other judges who oversaw an effort to recuse him from a dispute involving bankrupt energy company McDermott International. Ethics experts have said the undisclosed relationship casts doubt on the integrity of Jones' court. The misconduct complaint has already led to a call for further review in the case of Tehum Care Services, a bankrupt affiliate of prison healthcare company Corizon, and could lead to similar challenges in other cases in which Freeman or Jackson Walker were involved. Jackson Walker declined to comment on the resignation, but resisted any suggestion their work could be up for further review. \"From the time we first learned of this allegation Ms. Freeman was instructed not to work or bill on any cases before Judge Jones. We are confident that we acted responsibly,\u201d the firm said in a statement. Freeman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The office of the U.S. Trustee, which serves as the Department of Justice's bankruptcy watchdog, said on Friday that Tehum's restructuring should not be approved given new questions about the \"propriety\" of Jones' role in the case. Jones served as mediator during bankruptcy negotiations in which Freeman also took part. Jones has been the most active bankruptcy judge in the U.S. since January 2016, overseeing 11% of all Chapter 11 bankruptcies involving more than $100 million in liabilities, according to data from Debtwire, which provides research and intelligence on credit markets.

        "text": " (Bloomberg) -- The tagline from Wall Street was that 2023 was the year of the bond. Instead, fund managers are coming to terms with one of the toughest years ever. Most Read from Bloomberg Israel Latest: Army Says Over 600,000 Gazans Have Fled South US Pushes Bid to Avert Wider Israel War After Iran Warning Israel Latest: Biden and Abbas Talk as Gaza Invasion Nears Your Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas War Global Markets Stable as US Pushes to Contain Middle East War Lacy Hunt, Hoisington Investment Management Co.\u2019s 81-year-old chief economist, who\u2019s been analyzing markets, Federal Reserve policy and the economy for around a half-century, says it\u2019s been the hardest of his entire career. At HSBC Holdings Plc, Steve Major says he was \u201cwrong\u201d to assume the US government\u2019s growing supply of bonds didn\u2019t matter. Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley finally joined Bank of America and moved to a neutral position on Treasuries. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very, very humbling year,\u201d Hunt said. A 13% year-to-date loss for the firm\u2019s Wasatch-Hoisington U.S. Treasury Fund comes on top of 2022\u2019s 34% drop, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Last year\u2019s steep losses were easier to explain to clients \u2014 everyone knows bond prices suffer when inflation is high and central banks are driving up interest rates. The expectation in 2023 was that the US economy would crater under the weight of the sharpest run of hikes in decades \u2014 bringing gains for bonds on the expectation of policy loosening to come. Instead, even as inflation slowed, jobs data and other key measures of the economy\u2019s health remained strong, keeping the threat of faster price growth ever-present. Yields catapulted to highs not seen since 2007, putting the Treasury market on course for an unprecedented third year of annual losses. And without the Federal Reserve in the market buying bonds to hold down borrowing costs, the US\u2019s massive deficits \u2014 and the ballooning issuance needed to plug them \u2014 now matter in a way they didn\u2019t before. Hoisington\u2019s Hunt and his colleagues constantly discussed whether to conduct a wholesale alteration of their favorable view on long-term debt, as their assumption that slowing inflation would curb yields failed to materialize. They did trim their duration earlier in the year, but not sufficiently. \u201cWe thought that inflation would come down and it did,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cIn fact, there has been no decline that large in inflation that has not been involved with a recession in its immediate aftermath in the past. So the fact that gross domestic product is still rising is unprecedented.\u201d At the same time, it\u2019s the expectation that a contraction will eventually happen that\u2019s keeping Wall Street\u2019s bruised bulls from retreating too far as they try to manage their so-called constrained funds that can invest solely in the Treasury market. \u201cA hard landing is coming,\u201d Hunt said. Attractive Levels Bob Michele, chief investment officer for fixed income at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, trimmed the overweight position he\u2019d built in Treasuries when 10-year yields hit 4.30%. They\u2019ve risen by more than 50 basis points since. While the current levels look attractive, the 40-year bond-market veteran is waiting for the dust to settle. \u201cWe have to respect the market technicals and see where this can wash out,\u201d said Michele, who earlier this year predicted yields could come down as low as 3% across the curve by August. If yields on longer maturities go above 5.25% and the employment market stays firm, then it\u2019s time to retreat for real, he said. For a year touted by the likes of Vanguard Group Inc. and private equity giant KKR & Co Inc as the point where Treasuries roar back \u2014 an \u201canchor in the storm,\u201d Michele said at the time \u2014 the reality has been sobering. Since April, the 10-year Treasury yield has posted back-to-back monthly gains. And while the bond market has clawed back some losses in the past week, it\u2019s fueled by traders hunting the least-risky assets as the war between Israel and Hamas stokes fears of escalation. Behind the gains the core uncertainty hasn\u2019t gone away, with the Fed signaling that the next change in interest rates could be a hike. Read More: US Consumer Prices Rise at Brisk Pace for Second Straight Month To be sure, a U-turn now would be costly: many long positions were opened when yields were at 3.75%, according to data compiled by Jefferies International. And even after the bond slump, there are still metrics that suggest investors can sit tight for longer. The so-called yield-to-duration ratio \u2014 a gauge of how much bond yields would need to climb to wipe out the value of future interest payments \u2014 is hovering around 89 basis points.

        "text": " (Bloomberg) -- Israel should manage to avoid its first ever rating downgrade thanks to sound finances, unless the war with Hamas drags on for a long time, a top official in charge of the country\u2019s debt said. Most Read from Bloomberg Israel Latest: Army Says Over 600,000 Gazans Have Fled South US Pushes Bid to Avert Wider Israel War After Iran Warning Israel Latest: Biden and Abbas Talk as Gaza Invasion Nears Your Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas War Global Markets Stable as US Pushes to Contain Middle East War A downgrade to Israel\u2019s sovereign credit rating is an extreme scenario, said a senior official at the Finance Ministry\u2019s General Accountants\u2019 Office. A more realistic possibility is that Israel will be put on credit watch, said the official, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the information. Through wars, conflicts and global economic crises, Israel has never been downgraded by any of the major ratings companies. But its ranking was already under pressure before the unprecedented Oct. 7 attacks by the Palestinian militant group, with credit assessors taking an increasingly dim view of the government\u2019s controversial efforts to weaken the power of the judiciary. For more on the Israel-Hamas war, click here The cost to insure Israeli bonds against potential default has soared to the highest point in a decade last week. That makes it more expensive than the credit-default swaps of countries including Peru, rated three levels lower than Israel. Moody\u2019s Investors Service postponed a planned review of Israel\u2019s rating on Friday, saying it continued to evaluate the wider credit risk of recent hostilities. The resilience of Israeli debt issuers is at stake if a conflict stretches on, the ratings agency said in a separate note earlier last week. The Gaza conflict will bring on an increase in government expenditures, a decrease in tax collection and a growth in government deficit, the official said. Still, Israel does not anticipate any impact on its financing capabilities because it has a strong fiscal cushion. Israeli Central Bank Governor, Amir Yaron, also expressed confidence in the economy\u2019s resilience. \u201cEvery war has a considerable economic dimension that includes the impact to the financial markets, and with so many reserve soldiers at the front-lines and civilians in shelters, there is an effect on real economy, Yaron said in a video address to the G-30 forum in Marrakech. \u201cHowever, with the appropriate budget adjustments, that I believe are manageable , there should be no major changes to Israel\u2019s fundamental fiscal position,\u201d he added. Economic Cost Israel has vowed to wipe out Hamas in response to the assault that killed 1,300 people in southern Israel. It\u2019s preparing for a ground offensive against the group in the Gaza Strip, fueling speculation of a prolonged war. There are fears a second front could open in the north with Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based militia. The economic cost of the conflict would probably run to at least 27 billion shekels ($6.8 billion), according to Bank Hapoalim in Tel Aviv. Israel\u2019s relatively low public debt, at 60% of gross domestic product, and a budget deficit of around 2% suggests that the government has room to increase spending, especially for defense. Prospective aid by the US could further support its additional spending needs, Deutsche Bank AG strategists said. Policymakers have sought to limit the market fallout from the worst attack on Israel in decades, with the central bank pledging to sell as much as $30 billion from its reserves to support the currency, as well as to extend up to $15 billion through swap mechanisms. Those pledges seem to be stabilizing some corners of the local market, for now. --With assistance from Netty Ismail. (Adds Moody\u2019s comments in fifth paragraph.)

The pace of expansion for July-September compared with a year ago probably slowed to 4.5%, below Beijing\u2019s annual growth target of about 5%. Earlier data for the quarter contained some promising figures that supported a steadying of economic activity, with factory activity improving and a drop in exports moderating as authorities rolled out stimulus and eased restrictive real estate policies. Rreleases in the coming week on industrial output, retail sales and unemployment are expected to show how widespread that stabilization is. The recovery remains uneven, though. Consumer prices returned to the brink of deflation in September, data on Friday showed. Home sales have also failed to mount a turnaround, which may weigh on investment and counter any support from stronger government-led infrastructure spending. \u201cThe upcoming September activity data will be important to watch,\u201d said Xiaojia Zhi, head of research at Credit Agricole CIB. While the figures \u201cmay also send the message that the Chinese economy could be showing more signs of stabilizing, uncertainty remains related to the continued property drag.\u201d Questions also remain about how much additional stimulus China will roll out to support the economy. The People\u2019s Bank of China on Monday will set the rate on its one-year medium term lending facility, a key policy rate. Economists broadly expect that to remain unchanged for now, though several expect a cut before the end of 2023. There may be other measures on the horizon as well. China is considering raising its budget deficit for the year by issuing more debt to spent on infrastructure, Bloomberg reported. Authorities are also mulling the formation of a state-backed stabilization fund to shore up stock market confidence, while the nation\u2019s sovereign wealth fund recently purchased the equivalent of about $65 million worth of shares in the nation\u2019s biggest banks.

Click here for what happened last week and below is our wrap of what\u2019s coming up in the global economy. US and Canada Following data showing still-brisk inflation, investors will parse comments by Jerome Powell on whether the Fed is leaning toward another rate hike before year-end. The Fed chairman addresses the Economic Club of New York on Thursday \u2014 the headline event in a hectic week of speeches. Regional Fed bank presidents Patrick Harker, Thomas Barkin, Neel Kashkari, Lorie Logan, Loretta Mester and Austan Goolsbee are slated to appear at various events. Fed Governors Lisa Cook and Christopher Waller will also speak. Among upcoming economic data, retail sales are expected to reveal subdued consumer demand as the third quarter drew to a close. The September value of purchases, unadjusted for price changes, is seen rising about half as much as in the previous month. Tuesday\u2019s release may also show a decline in so-called control group sales, the first such decrease in six months. These sales, which exclude receipts at food service establishments, auto dealers, building materials stores and gas stations, are used to calculate spending on most goods in the GDP report. Another report in the coming week is expected to show the weakest annual rate of existing-home sales since 2010 as the real estate market continues to suffer from high borrowing costs and limited inventory. Housing starts, meanwhile, probably snapped back after plunging in August on a slump in multifamily home construction. In Canada, among several reports due, a highlight will be inflation on Tuesday, which will show whether price gains of about 4% on key measures have slowed further. For more, read Bloomberg Economics\u2019 full Week Ahead for the US Asia Away from China, the week starts with voters in New Zealand having opted for a new conservative government in Saturday\u2019s general election. Inflation figures out Tuesday will likely show that the cost-of-living crunch continues to weigh on households there, even as food-price growth is slowing. Three Reserve Bank of Australia officials will speak in the coming week, with Governor Michele Bullock continuing to flesh out the vision of her fledgling leadership on Wednesday. Jobs figures come out the following day. Bank Indonesia is expected to hold rates steady on Thursday, as it\u2019s done since raising them in January. That\u2019s also likely the case for the Bank of Korea, even as inflation there heats up again. Trade data from Indonesia, Malaysia and Japan is also released during the week. Tokyo\u2019s main event is likely to be Thursday\u2019s unveiling of union pay demands for next year. Bank of Japan officials citing the need for strong wage gains will likely watch that announcement closely, alongside nationwide CPI figures on Friday. For more, read Bloomberg Economics\u2019 full Week Ahead for Asia Europe, Middle East, Africa The UK will take center stage for Europe. After numbers on Thursday showed that growth stayed weak in August, further releases will signal to Bank of England officials whether their recent pause in rate hiking is justified. On Tuesday, wage data may point to weakening pressures in August, with accompanying labor-market numbers also probably showing a loss of momentum. The following day, core inflation, which strips out volatile elements such as energy, as well as headline CPI, are anticipated to have fallen in September. It\u2019s a quieter week in the euro zone. Germany\u2019s ZEW gauge of investor confidence is released on Tuesday, while euro-area inflation data on Wednesday may confirm initial readings that showed weakening pressures. For the European Central Bank, the first three days of the week will mark the end of a pre-decision window to speak out on monetary policy before officials meet on Oct. 26. Central bank governors from France, Spain, the Netherlands and Germany are among those scheduled to deliver remarks. ECB President Christine Lagarde will be in Luxembourg on Monday for a meeting of euro-zone finance ministers that US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is also scheduled to attend. Italian Finance Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti will be there as well, but only after he presents his budget law that incorporates the looser fiscal plans of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni\u2019s coalition. A sovereign rating assessment for Italy is due from Standard and Poor\u2019s on Friday. Turning north, several Riksbank officials are due to speak, including Governor Erik Thedeen \u2014 remarks that may be closely watched after evidence of stubborn core inflation added to the case for another rate hike next month. In the Middle East, Israel publishes data on Sunday that will probably show price increases didn\u2019t accelerate last month after an upside surprise in August took inflation above 4%. The outlook is now in flux as the shock of Hamas attacks on Israel leads to a military escalation that\u2019s likely to scar the economy by hurting consumption, investment and tourism. The market no longer expects a rate hike from the Bank of Israel and is positioning instead for its first monetary easing since the pandemic. A decision is currently scheduled for Oct. 23. In Africa, data on Monday will likely show Nigeria\u2019s inflation quickened for a ninth straight month, to over 27%. That may see the central bank, under new leadership, raise borrowing costs at its next meeting. On Tuesday, South Africa\u2019s monetary officials will issue a review on domestic and international developments that affect their policy. Data the next day may show September\u2019s inflation quickened from the 4.8% reading seen in August, buoyed by transport. A weaker rand, higher oil costs and an outbreak of avian flu could keep price gains elevated for some time. Forward-rate agreements starting in two months \u2014 used to speculate on borrowing costs \u2014 show traders are pricing in a 70% chance of a quarter-point increase Nov. 23.

Economists surveyed by the central bank have almost tripled their 2023 GDP forecast to 2.92% since early May. Data on Sunday showed that Peru\u2019s economy shrank in August for a fourth month in a row, extending its recession as analysts begin to grapple with the possibility the economy may contract in full-year 2023. In Colombia, August\u2019s GDP-proxy print should show an economy that\u2019s barely expanding. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg have trimmed their third-quarter output forecast to 0.7% from 1%. Elsewhere, the central banks of Brazil and Colombia post surveys of economists, while Citibanamex publishes its bi-weekly survey of Mexican analysts. The region\u2019s two biggest economies report retail sales figures for August. In the two decades starting in 2000 Brazil\u2019s results easily outpaced Mexico\u2019s. But since the height of the pandemic that relationship has flipped: since January 2021, Mexico\u2019s retail sales have been humming along at a year-on-year average of 9.6% to Brazil\u2019s sluggish 1.8% pace.

        "text": " By Anirban Sen (Reuters) -Ineos Chair Jim Ratcliffe would pay over $1.5 billion for a 25% stake in Manchester United Plc were his bid for the iconic soccer club to be accepted by the Glazer family that controls it, a person familiar with the matter said on Sunday. The terms of Ratcliffe's bid, reported here for the first time, infer a valuation on Manchester United of close to $6.5 billion, excluding its net debt of more than $600 million, the source said. That is slightly higher than a rival offer from Qatar's Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al Thani for $100% of the Premier League club. Manchester United is currently valued by the stock market at $3.3 billion. Sheikh Jassim informed the Glazer family in the last few days that he would not be raising his bid further. The Glazers have not yet reached a deal with Ratcliffe and negotiations may continue at least until the end of the month, the source said. The Glazer family, which made its fortune in real estate, retail and healthcare and also owns the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, bought the team for 790 million pounds ($960 million) in 2005. The six descendants of American businessman Malcolm Glazer, who died in 2014, together control 96% of Manchester United's voting stock. The deal structure that Ratcliffe has proposed would allow members of the Glazer family, as well as other shareholders, to partially cash out, the source said. Ratcliffe has offered to be in charge of hiring and managing talent at Manchester United should his bid prevail, the source said. Some club fans have criticized the Glazers over the years over their handling of this key aspect of Manchester United's operations. The source requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Manchester United and Ratcliffe did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ratcliffe founded Ineos in 1998 and is the chemical group's chairman and chief executive officer, with a two-thirds stake. Forbes pegs Ratcliffe's net worth at $18.7 billion. The British billionaire is no stranger to the business of sports. Ineos owns French Ligue 1 club Nice, Swiss Super League side FC Lausanne-Sport, and works with partner club Racing Club Abidjan of Ivory Coast Ligue One. It is also behind the Grenadiers, one of the world's most successful cycling teams. The Glazers' valuation expectations have been aggressive based on other soccer deals. Last year, the $3.1 billion acquisition of Chelsea Football Club by an investment group led by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital valued it at 5.7 times revenue for its last financial year. The valuation proposed by Ratcliffe is equivalent to more than 11 times Manchester United's revenue over the last 12 months, according to LSEG data. The club announced in November 2022 that the Glazers were exploring cashing out on their ownership. Record 20-time English champions, Manchester United has over 650 million fans worldwide, according to market research firm Kantar. A large number of them have been clamoring for a change of ownership. That is because the Glazers have overseen a significant downturn in the club's fortunes, with the club winning just the last of their 20 top-flight titles. Manchester United won the League Cup under Erik ten Hag this season, but their third-place finish in the league, 14 points behind local rivals and treble winners Manchester City, underscores the scale of the turnaround required.

        "text": " (Bloomberg) -- Poland\u2019s opposition is on track for a majority in Sunday\u2019s election, an exit poll showed, an upset that would deny the ruling nationalists a third term and steer the country back into the European mainstream. Most Read from Bloomberg Israel Latest: Army Says Over 600,000 Gazans Have Fled South US Pushes Bid to Avert Wider Israel War After Iran Warning Israel Latest: Biden and Abbas Talk as Gaza Invasion Nears Your Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas War Global Markets Stable as US Pushes to Contain Middle East War The Civic Platform under former European Council President Donald Tusk won 32% of the vote, according to the Ipsos survey for the country\u2019s main broadcasters. The Third Way alliance had 13%, with the Left party at 8.6%, giving the three groups 248 seats in the 460-strong lower house of parliament. The poll put turnout at an estimated 73%, an all-time record. Victory for the opposition would end a tumultuous period in Poland\u2019s relationship with the European Union, which has withheld more than \u20ac35 billion ($37 billion) to punish Warsaw for curbing the independence of judges and the media during eight years of Law & Justice rule. The zloty gained after the result was announced. \u201cThis is the end of the bad times, the end of Law & Justice rule,\u201d Tusk told jubilant supporters in Warsaw after exit poll results were announced. \u201cPoland won, democracy won.\u201d The ruling Law & Justice party took the most votes with 37%, a result that would in theory give it the first shot at forming a coalition. But that will prove fruitless as long as Tusk\u2019s allies have a blocking majority. A potential Law & Justice ally, the far-right Confederation party, took just 6.2% of the vote. Law & Justice leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski called the result a \u201cvictory,\u201d though said a third term for the nationalists was in doubt. \u201cThis we don\u2019t know yet,\u201d he told supporters. When Law & Justice came to power in 2015, Poland was seen as a poster child for Europe\u2019s post-communist transformation, but since then it has stacked the top court with allies and used the state broadcaster to pump out government propaganda. A win for Tusk would also mark a shift in the tide of populist forces in Europe. Slovakia\u2019s Robert Fico, a former premier and ally of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, is set to return to power this month after winning on a campaign to halt military aid to Ukraine and migration. Poland has been polarized by an election campaign that featured vicious personal attacks traded between Tusk and Law & Justice leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski. Tusk was accused by the ruling party of being too cozy with Moscow \u2014 and of taking orders from Berlin. In government, Tusk would face a challenge in unifying parties whose differences prevented them from running on a joint platform in the election. He would also contend with a head of state, Andrzej Duda, who is a former Law & Justice member able to veto legislation. Monetary policy would also likely be impacted, since the central bank governor, Adam Glapinski, has close ties to the ruling party and was accused last month of seeking to tilt the playing field with an outsized interest-rate cut ahead of the vote. --With assistance from Piotr Skolimowski, Maciej Martewicz and Isobel Finkel.

His comments came hours after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the UK stood unequivocally with Israel, making no mention of the plight facing Palestinian civilians.

He said among Israel's requests are additional interceptors for its Iron Dome missile defense system, which has been operating non-stop shooting down Hamas rockets from Gaza, and precision munitions. \"What about the House (of Representatives)? We're not waiting for the House. We believe if the Senate acts in a strong bipartisan way, it may indeed improve the chances that the House, even with its current dysfunction, will act,\" Schumer said. He also urged Israeli leaders to assist with fast and efficient humanitarian assistance, while minimizing civilian casualties, in Gaza. \"Unlike Hamas, civilized democracies, like the U.S. and like Israel must hold themselves to a higher standard ... we echoed that to the prime minister of Israel and to every Israeli official we met,\" he said.

        "text": " Young adults are surprisingly optimistic about their own financial futures despite crushing inflation and lingering fears of recession. A new study found that 80% of Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 are struggling or merely surviving financially. But the vast majority \u2014 72% \u2014 believe they'll be thriving in five years and 79% expect to get there in 30 years, according to the study from Edward Jones and MIT\u2019s AgeLab Next360, which polled 2,003 adults in that age group. The study offers insight into what this cohort wants from their lives as they age, and reveals how personal finance advice could help them overcome the challenges they face in getting there. \"While some feel like they're just surviving, maybe barely keeping their head above water, they must feel deep down, 'I just need a few years. I need one break. Just one break in my life to finally pay this student loan off or this credit card debt,'\" said Andrew Herzog, a financial planner at the Watchman Group. \"If I just got that monkey off my back, I could finally really start climbing that ladder.\" Read more: Can you change your student loan repayment plan? Overall, the study found only 21% said they\u2019re \"thriving\" now, while 57% said they\u2019re \"surviving,\" and 23% said they\u2019re struggling. But in five years, 72% see themselves \"thriving,\" with just 22% forecasting they\u2019ll still be just \"surviving\" and 6% saying they'll still be struggling. In 30 years, there\u2019s greater optimism \u2014 79% envision themselves as thriving, while only 16% said they would be surviving and 4% said they would be struggling. The study also revealed that these adults share many of the same life goals as previous generations. The survey found that 80% have or want children and that 65% of study participants hope to be homeowners one day. Meanwhile, 2 in 3 have married or expect to in the future. But despite their ambition and optimism, these adults face many challenges getting to where they want to be. These adults reported that basic living expenses and rising inflation are the biggest obstacles to achieving their five-year goals. Just 13% have paid off college debt, only 31% have a retirement account, and 57% have health insurance, according to the study. Nearly 20% have already been laid off from a job. \"For those who are planning to have kids or just had or had kids, health care, childcare is incredibly expensive. Daycare for myself is about the cost of my mortgage,\" said Eric Scruggs, a financial planner at Hark Financial Planning. \"And so there's a lot to balance with the cost of living, and wages haven't particularly kept up.\" The study also pointed out that many members of this group grew up in the shadow of the Great Recession, which influenced their relationship with money. \"They saw parents lose their jobs and homes,\" Lena Haas, head of wealth management advice and solutions at Edward Jones, said. \"And so I think that having that experience, really shapes the desire of this generation to create a solid financial foundation. It's not just about the money. It's about having peace of mind and security.\" To do that, these adults will need to balance their desire for meaning and flexibility at work with their hope for the benefits of a more traditional life, which can be expensive, Scruggs said. \"You've got to balance what you want to accomplish today and working maybe in a career that you may find more personally meaningful than financially rewarding, but making sure that that doesn't set you back for achieving your other longer term goals and objectives,\" said Scruggs. \"And at least, if nothing else, understand the trade off you're making so that you're making an informed choice. According to the study, nearly 80% handle their finances without the help of a financial planner. But of that group, over 40% they plan on working with one someday. The study found that nearly 70% view financial advisers as \"a sounding board for ideas.\" Read more: Top savings tools \u2014 4 alternatives to savings accounts Instead, right now these adults rely on various other sources for financial advice. Over 50% speak to their parents about financial planners and surprisingly, despite their tech forward image, only 20% reported \"using social media or influencers as sources of financial guidance,\" according to the study. Nearly 70% of survey participants said they don\u2019t have money for professional advice, but Scruggs noted that professional help is becoming more accessible. \"There's more and more advisers launching business models specifically for this next gen set of clients that can help them in a cost-effective manner and help set up solid foundations and solid habits,\" he said. \"That, like I said, will compound over decades to lead to meaningfully different retirement for these folks.\" Dylan Croll is a Yahoo Finance reporter.

        "text": " A new federal rule next year will make it easier for borrowers paying back their student loans to also save for their retirement. Section 110 of the SECURE 2.0 Act, legislation signed into law last December, will allow employers to provide 401(k), 403(b), or SIMPLE IRA matching for qualified student loan payments. The provision is optional and effective January 2024. This change helps to address a longstanding challenge for most borrowers: paying back student debt prevents them from saving for other goals, a problem that has resurfaced now that federal loan payments are no longer on pause. Additionally, this provision can benefit employers as far as retention, reducing attrition, and recruiting new talent. \"It\u2019s impossible to ignore the long-term financial impact student loan repayments can have on employees across all generations,\" Eric Stevenson, president of Nationwide Retirement Solutions, said in a statement. \"The good news is SECURE 2.0 Act now allows employers to provide matching retirement plan contributions based on the amount of an employee\u2019s student debt repayments \u2014 a provision Nationwide advocated for and is excited to further innovate on.\" Read more: Should you refinance your student loans? Around 67% of graduates with student loans said the debt prevents them from contributing to things like a retirement plan, according to a 2023 Fidelity study. For borrowers earning less than $50,000, 77% said student loan payments would affect retirement savings, according to a Corebridge study. One in 10 employees over the age of 45 have student loan debt and 61% agree repayment has negatively impacted their financial stability, according to a Nationwide survey, with 66% noting repayment will significantly affect their ability to save for retirement. With the average borrower having a monthly payment between $200 and $500, that's real money that can help secure borrowers' futures. Read more: Tips and tricks for quickly paying off student loans \"For example, if an employee has a $300 monthly student loan payment and can\u2019t afford 401(k) contributions, the student loan payments are treated as 401(k) contributions,\" Ross Solverud, retirement plan compliance leader at Sentry Insurance, told Yahoo Finance. \"As of 2024, employers have the option to 'match' student loan payments as if the loan payments were 401(k) contributions.\" But it isn\u2019t limited to employees who haven\u2019t made contributions. If an employee isn\u2019t maximizing their full match due to student loan payments, they will also benefit from the provision. \"If an employee has a salary of $60,000 with a 5% match on 401(k) contribution, but only contributes 3% due to $600 a month in student loan payments, they are leaving 2% or $1,200 on the table,\" Stevenson said. \"With the SECURE 2.0 provision, they\u2019ll be able to use their student loan payments towards the 2% to get the full 5% match.\" Around 49% of employers plan to offer the matching qualified student loan payment provision, according to a survey by the Employee Research Benefits Institute (ERBI). \"Employers can adopt the benefit in a variety of ways, so long as they have a matching provision, and the student loan payments are for qualified student loans,\" Amanda Hahnel, vice president and head of student debt retirement at Fidelity Investments, told Yahoo Finance. \"Additionally, employees need to certify the amount of payments paid.\" Qualified student loans can be for private or federal loans, so long as they were incurred by the employee for qualified higher education expenses of the employee, which is typically considered the cost of attendance like tuition, room and board, books, and fees. Read more: Are federal or private student loans better? \"Employers provide information about student loan payments, track payments, and at the end of the year the employer matches up to contribution limits,\" Hahnel. \"Some employers may choose to allow employees to do a self-certification, which means an understanding of what's allowable, like the type of loan.\" The certification process may vary from monthly, quarterly, or annually depending on the employer. \"The legislation requires at least an annual certification, but is fairly broad, giving the employer the ability to create the process and procedures around certification,\" Stevenson said. Employees have until three months after the year-end to claim the benefit, if offered by their employer. Because this is a voluntary provision, with open enrollment occurring, employees should ask their human resources or benefits manager whether they plan to adopt the provision. \"We never want to leave an employer match on the table and qualified student loan payments should be no different,\" Jim Mahaney, a certified financial planner at Mavericus Retirement Services LLC, told Yahoo Finance. \"I would counsel clients to determine in the fourth quarter if they are potentially missing out on any remaining potential 401(k) employer match and to do a one-time prepayment of principal to their student loan if they are.\" \"With women retiring with 30% less than men and 54% of Black Americans not having enough savings to retire, this provision helps,\" Doug Ornstein, wealth manager and a certified financial adviser at TIAA, told Yahoo Finance. More than 81% of businesses said employees have asked about more steps to prepare for retirement and 39% noticed an increase in employees leaving for jobs with better benefits over the past year, according to the Nationwide survey. Because it is a voluntary provision, employee demand will be a big driver for employers to participate. \"Between student loans, interest rate increases and inflation, employees have a lot to navigate when planning for retirement,\" Stevenson said. \"There is a strong business imperative for employers to help.\" Ronda is a personal finance senior reporter for Yahoo Finance and attorney with experience in law, insurance, education, and government.

        "text": " The medicine in the diabetes drug Mounjaro helped people with obesity or who are overweight lose at least a quarter of their body weight, or about 60 pounds on average, when combined with intensive diet and exercise, a new study shows. By comparison, a group of people who also dieted and exercised, but then received dummy shots, lost weight initially but then regained some, researchers reported Sunday in the journal Nature Medicine. \u201cThis study says that if you lose weight before you start the drug, you can then add a lot more weight loss after,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Wadden, a University of Pennsylvania obesity researcher and psychology professor who led the study. The results, which were also presented Sunday at a medical conference, confirm that the drug made by Eli Lilly & Co. has the potential to be one of the most powerful medical treatments for obesity to date, outside experts said. \u201cAny way you slice it, it's a quarter of your total body weight,\" said Dr. Caroline Apovian, who treats obesity at Brigham and Women's Hospital and wasn't involved in the study. The injected drug, tirzepatide, was approved in the U.S. in May 2022 to treat diabetes. Sold as Mounjaro, it has been used \u201coff-label\u201d to treat obesity, joining a frenzy of demand for diabetes and weight-loss medications including Ozempic and Wegovy, made by Novo Nordisk. All the drugs, which carry retail price tags of $900 a month or more, have been in shortage for months. Tirzepatide targets two hormones that kick in after people eat to regulate appetite and the feeling of fullness communicated between the gut and the brain. Semaglutide, the drug used in Ozempic and Wegovy, targets one of those hormones. The new study, which was funded by Eli Lilly, enrolled about 800 people who had obesity or were overweight with a weight-related health complication \u2014 but not diabetes. On average, study participants weighed about 241 pounds (109.5 kilograms) to start and had a body-mass index \u2014 a common measure of obesity \u2014 of about 38. After three months of intensive diet and exercise, more than 200 participants left the trial, either because they failed to lose enough weight or for other reasons. The remaining nearly 600 people were randomized to receive tirzepatide or a placebo via weekly injections for about 16 months. Nearly 500 people completed the study. Participants in both groups lost about 7% of their body weight, or almost 17 pounds (8 kilograms), during the diet-and-exercise phase. Those who received the drug went on to lose an additional 18.4% of initial body weight, or about 44 pounds (20 kilograms) more, on average. Those who received the dummy shots regained about 2.5% of their initial weight, or 6 pounds (2.7 kilograms). Overall, about 88% of those taking tirzepatide lost 5% or more of their body weight during the trial, compared with almost 17% of those taking placebo. Nearly 29% of those taking the drug lost at least a quarter of their body weight, compared with just over 1% of those taking placebo. That's higher than the results for semaglutide and similar to the results seen with bariatric surgery, said Apovian. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a medical gastric bypass,\u201d she said. Side effects including nausea, diarrhea and constipation were reported more frequently in people taking the drug than those taking the placebo. They were mostly mild to moderate and occurred primarily as the dose of the drug was escalated, the study found. More than 10% of those taking the drug discontinued the study because of side effects, compared with about 2% of those on placebo. Lilly is expected to publish the results soon of another study that the firm says shows similar high rates of weight loss. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted the company a fast-track review of the drug to treat obesity, which Eli Lilly may sell under a different brand name. A decision is expected by the end of the year. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.

        "text": " ExxonMobil (XOM)'s near-$60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) highlights Big Oil's continued appetite for shale producers. The deal,\u00a0announced earlier this week, will make the oil giant the largest player in US shale oil. It\u00a0gives ExxonMobil massive scale in the Permian Basin, allowing it to double its footprint in the largest oil-producing region in the US and strengthen its upstream portfolio. Upstream refers to the initial phases of oil and gas production like exploration, drilling, and extraction. Big Oil players have increasingly turned to the Permian Basin for oil and gas, where technological advancements and infrastructure have led to lower extraction costs. \u201cPeople are definitely going to run out of inventory over the next several years,\u201d Pioneer's CEO Scott Sheffield said during the company's latest earnings call on Aug. 2. That \u201cshould lead to extreme consolidation.\u201d Analysts note consolidation has been a way of life in the oil patch for some time. In recent years, supermajor Chevron (CVX) acquired Nobel Energy, an oil and gas explorer with 92,000 acres in the Permian Basin. A year later ConocoPhillips (COP) bought Shell's Permian Basin business for $10 billion and Concho Resources for $17 billion. In 2019 shale producer Anadarko was scooped up by Occidental Petroleum (OXY) with the help of billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B). Last year, Occidental Petroleum was the best-performing stock of the S&P 500, up a whopping 119%. \u201cA few remain, but the Permian Basin has seen production start to concentrate in the hands of Chevron, Occidental, ConocoPhillips, and ExxonMobil,\u201d said Peter\u00a0McNally, global sector lead for industrials, materials, and energy at Third Bridge. Citi analysts recently noted \u201cthe logic of consolidation in the highly fragmented Permian shale remains compelling with significant gains to be achieved from economies of scale by minimizing facilities spend, optimizing drilling and reducing G&A [general and administrative] spend.\u201d The Pioneer acquisition is Exxon's largest since it merged with Mobil back in 1999. The deal comes at a time when the US and other countries are moving towards an economy that is less reliant on fossil fuels. Exxon's acquisition highlights the challenges of that shift. \"Everybody realizes there's going to be an energy transition, but it's going to be a lot longer. It's going to be a lot tougher. It's going to be a lot more expensive,\" Wells Fargo senior energy analyst Roger Read told Yahoo Finance. \"So if you look at that aspect of it \u2014 it speaks to why you would invest in oil and why Exxon would do this transaction.\" Besides increasing capacity to produce more oil and gas for its downstream operations, Third Bridge\u2019s analyst Peter McNally points out an additional benefit of the merger. \u201cExxonMobil is pulling forward Pioneer's net-zero plan by 15 years \u2014 to 2035 \u2014 as the company can deploy its emission reduction targets across a bigger footprint of operations,\u201d he added. Net zero refers to pledges to remove the same amount of carbon from the atmosphere that a company releases, thereby counterbalancing the impact. The merger announcement comes as Pioneer's longtime CEO Scott Sheffield is poised to retire at the end of the year. Sheffield was Pioneer\u2019s founding CEO from 1997 to 2016. He returned to the chief executive role three years later, steering the company through the acquisitions of privately held rival DoublePoint Energy in 2021 and Parsley Energy in 2020 when the industry was reeling from lower oil prices brought on by the pandemic. Pioneer shares had soared last week amid speculation that ExxonMobil would buy Pioneer at a value of up to $60 billion. On Wednesday ExxonMobil sank 4% to hover above $105 per share after the merger was announced. The stock touched an all-time intraday high of $120.70 on Sept. 28.

        "text": " (Bloomberg) -- With the list of stock-market worries growing seemingly by the day, investors looking to earnings season for a dose of good news are hanging their hopes on a familiar group: Big Tech. Most Read from Bloomberg Israel Latest: Army Says Over 600,000 Gazans Have Fled South US Pushes Bid to Avert Wider Israel War After Iran Warning Israel Latest: Biden and Abbas Talk as Gaza Invasion Nears Your Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas War Global Markets Stable as US Pushes to Contain Middle East War After slashing thousands of jobs to cut costs, the biggest US technology and internet companies are pumping out profits similar to those generated two years ago when the pandemic sent sales of digital services and electronic devices soaring. The expectation now is that they\u2019ll help pick up the slack from industries like energy and health care that are still mired in an earnings slump. The five biggest companies in the S&P 500 Index \u2014 Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Nvidia Corp. \u2014 account for about a quarter of the benchmark\u2019s market capitalization. Their earnings are projected to jump 34% from a year earlier on average, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. The S&P 500 as a whole isn\u2019t looking nearly as strong. The index\u2019s profits are expected to be roughly flat, but they\u2019d face a drop of around 5% without those five behemoths. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for the big tech stocks to deliver\u201d and bolster confidence broadly, said Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management. \u201cThe Street expects earnings to be good across the board. Megacap tech stocks have whatever it takes to lead the market in the final quarter of the year.\u201d Leading the Market Soaring interest rates have rattled markets this month with the 10-year Treasury yield hitting the highest in more than a decade. A hotter-than-expected inflation report has investors bracing for the Federal Reserve to keep policy tight, and potentially hike again. That backdrop has reignited fears about a potential recession that have only been heightened by conflict in the Mideast. Tech stocks have faltered in the face of those headwinds, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 tumbling for two straight months. But they\u2019ve still hugely outperformed the overall market. The five key big-tech companies account for the bulk of the S&P 500\u2019s 13% advance this year. Netflix Inc. and Tesla Inc. are scheduled to kick off tech-related earnings Wednesday. Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta Platforms Inc. report the following week. Apple announces Nov. 2 and Nvidia on Nov. 21. After robust second-quarter earnings, \u201cwe need to see more of the same in the third-quarter results,\u201d said Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners. Given their big weighting, \u201cyou can bet that the rest of the market will play follow the leader as big tech earnings unfold this quarter.\u201d He said he sees \u201cfairly low odds of a tech earnings wreck this quarter.\u201d Investors have good reason to be optimistic. In the past century, the S&P 500 has rallied during reporting season about two-thirds of the time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Roadblocks Ahead One potential roadblock to an earnings-fueled rally is that a lot of the anticipated good news may be priced in. Alphabet and Amazon have gained more than 50% this year, while Apple and Microsoft have advanced nearly 40%. On top of rising profit expectations, the stocks have benefited from bets that the tech giants are best positioned to capitalize on generative artificial intelligence. That\u2019s despite Nvidia, whose shares have tripled this year, being the only one to show a substantial financial boost from the trend. A source of concern for investors is that even with recent declines, big tech\u2019s stock-market valuations are still elevated. Apple and Microsoft are priced at about 27 and 29 times estimated earnings, respectively, well above averages over the past decade. That figure is around 18 for the S&P 500 as a whole. Expensive share prices put pressure on companies to deliver strong earnings, according to Kim Forrest, founder and chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners. \u201cThey have to constantly deliver or they will lose the attention of investors,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cSomebody needs to keep buying, and these rich valuations need to be justified.\u201d Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek The K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTS Introducing The Businessweek Show With Max Abelson Has Bob Iger Lost the Magic?

In a statement, Unifin said it would issue a certain number of ordinary shares representing the variable part of the company's share capital to be subscribed and paid for by certain recognized creditors. Unifin said shareholders had agreed that 85% of the shares of the company's restructured capital stock will be distributed, pro rata, between common convertible loans, and certain reserves provided for in the bankruptcy agreement. It added 5% of the shares of the restructured stock will be assigned to a trust to implement an incentive plan for company officials; and that the remaining 10% will be distributed, pro rata, among Unifin's current shareholders.

        "text": " Movie theaters turned into concert venues this weekend as Swifties brought their dance moves and friendship bracelets to multiplexes across the country. The unparalleled enthusiasm helped propel \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d to a massive, first place debut between $95 million and $97 million in North America, AMC Theatres said Sunday. It\u2019s easily the biggest opening for a concert film of all time, and, not accounting for inflation, has made more than the $73 million \u201cJustin Bieber: Never Say Never\u201d earned in 2011. In today\u2019s dollars, that would be around $102 million. And if it comes in on the higher end of projections when totals are released Monday, it could be the biggest October opening ever. The one to beat is \u201cJoker,\u201d which launched to $96.2 million in 2019. A unique experiment in distribution, premium pricing, star power and loose movie theater etiquette\u2014more dancing and shouting than a Star Wars premiere\u2014have made it an undeniable hit. Compiled from Swift\u2019s summer shows at Southern California\u2019s SoFi Stadium, the film opened in 3,855 North American locations starting with \u201csurprise\u201d Thursday evening previews. Those showtimes helped boost its opening day sum to $39 million \u2013 the second biggest ever for October, behind \u201cJoker\u2019s\u201d $39.3 million. Internationally, it's estimated to have earned somewhere between $31 to $33 million, bringing its global total in the range of $126 million to $130 million. \u201cThis is a phenomenal number,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cTo have a blockbuster style opening weekend for a concert film is unprecedented.\u201d Swift, who produced the film, went around the Hollywood studio system to distribute the film, making a deal directly with AMC, the largest exhibition company in the United States. With her 274 million Instagram followers, Swift hardly needed a traditional marketing campaign to get the word out. Beyonc\u00e9 made a similar deal with the exhibitor for \u201c Renaissance: A Film By Beyonc\u00e9, \u201d which will open on Dec. 1. The two superstars posed together at the premiere of \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d earlier this week in Los Angeles. It was a needed injection of star power with Hollywood actors over 90 days into a strike that has left most red carpets void of glamourous talent and resulted in several high-profile films being pushed to next year. \u201cThe Eras Tour,\u201d directed by Sam Wrench, is not just playing on AMC screens either. The company, based in Leawood, Kansas, worked with sub-distribution partners Variance Films, Trafalgar Releasing, Cinepolis and Cineplex to show the film in more than 8,500 movie theatres globally in 100 countries. The spotlight on Swift has been especially intense lately as a result of her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. The two made separate surprise appearances on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d this weekend and were also photographed holding hands in New York. It led to some hyperbolic projections going into the weekend, with some analysts predicting that \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d could make over $125 million. Dergarabedian said it's common for outsized expectations to be attached to massive brands like Swift. There's also no precedent for something like \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d and a celebrity of Swift's stature. \u201cThe laws of gravity don't apply to Taylor Swift,\u201d Dergarabedian said. The film scored well with both critics and audiences, who gave it an A+ CinemaScore, a metric that typically signals a film will continue to do well after its first weekend. Elizabeth Frank, the executive vice president of worldwide programming and chief content officer for AMC Theatres, said in a statement that they are grateful to Taylor Swift. \u201cHer spectacular performance delighted fans, who dressed up and danced through the film,\u201d Frank said. \"With tremendous recommendations and fans buying tickets to see this concert film several times, we anticipate \u2018Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u2019 concert film playing to big audiences for weeks to come.\u201d The stadium tour, which continues internationally, famously crashed Ticketmaster\u2019s site and re-sale prices became astronomical. Pollstar projects that it will earn some $1.4 billion. The concert film offered fans both better seats and a much more affordable way to see the show for the first or fifth time. Prices are higher than the national average, at $19.89, which references her birth year and 2014 album, and ran closer to $29 a pop for premium large format screens like IMAX. Even so, they are significantly less than seat at one of the stadium shows. Showtimes are also more limited than a standard Hollywood blockbuster, but AMC is guaranteeing at least four a day on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays at all AMC locations in the U.S. Many locations also specified that there are no refunds or exchanges. And fans will have to wait a while for \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d to be available on streaming \u2014 part of the AMC deal was a 13-week exclusive theatrical run. Michael O\u2019Leary, CEO of the National Association of Theater Owners said in a statement the moment was, \u201cAnother landmark weekend for cinemas.\u201d \u201cThis year has been marked by unprecedented experiences for movie lovers in theaters across this nation,\u201d O\u2019Leary continued in a statement. \u201cThe \u2018Eras Tour\u2019 debut proves, yet again, that fans are eager to share other experiences in a communal way, with theater owners working creatively to build memorable moments in their cinemas.\u201d O\u2019Leary said that a survey of 6,000 people by his organization and The Cinema Foundation found that 72% want to see more concert films on the big screen. \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d accounted for over 70% of the total weekend box office grosses. \u201cThe Exorcist: Believer\u201d placed a very distant second in its second weekend with $11 million, followed by the \u201cPaw Patrol\u201d movie in third with $7 million.

        "text": " (Recasts with global box office figures, adds quotes and background throughout) By Lisa Richwine LOS ANGELES, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Pop singer Taylor Swift ruled movie box offices over the weekend as her concert film transformed darkened theaters into dance floors and hauled in an estimated $126 million-plus around the world. Moviegoers dressed in concert T-shirts and sequins for screenings of \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour.\" At many showings, fans stood to sing along and move to the beat of \"Shake It Off,\" \"Anti-Hero\" and other hits from Swift's 17-year career. The turnout provided a welcome jolt to cinemas facing a lackluster autumn slate after a strike by Hollywood actors prompted studios to delay titles such as \"Dune: Part Two.\" U.S. and Canadian ticket sales for \"The Eras Tour\" were expected to reach $95 million to $97 million by the end of Sunday, distributor AMC Theatres said. That would surpass the $73 million that Justin Bieber's 2011 release \"Never Say Never,\" the current record holder for a concert film, collected over its entire run. \"This is a superstar debut,\" Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co., said of Swift's film. \"It was a party in a movie theater.\" \"The Eras Tour\" added as much as $33 million in international markets, according to AMC estimates, for a global total of $126 million to $130 million. The concert is set to be shown in theatres in more countries including Brazil, South Korea and Malaysia in November. Final weekend results will be released on Monday. If current estimates hold, Swift's domestic tally will fall short of the most bullish projections from box office analysts, who had forecast $100 million to $140 million. Turnout had been tricky to predict, analysts said, because the film was different from the blockbuster action movies that normally top box office charts. No movie debut in October has ever exceeded $100 million domestically. \"Joker\" brought in $96.2 million in 2019. Overall, domestic ticket sales for all of 2023 so far were running 26% ahead of last year, according to Comscore data, but nearly 17% below 2019's pre-pandemic tally. Studios have released 16 fewer films in theaters this year compared to the same point in 2019. Swift fans were thrilled to see the Eras Tour on the big screen. Many missed the chance to see the singer in person after ticket seller Ticketmaster suffered outages and resale prices for seats soared into the thousands of dollars. \"Given how hard it is to get a ticket to a concert, I think it is really fantastic that people who aren't fortunate enough to get there get the opportunity to see it in a venue like this,\" moviegoer Stephanie Gaudette said at a screening at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. \"The Eras Tour,\" recorded at shows at SoFi Stadium outside Los Angeles, received a rare A+ score in audience polling by CinemaScore, and a 100% positive rating from film critics on the Rotten Tomatoes website. Pop singer Beyonce will follow Swift by bringing her Renaissance Tour to theaters in December, another release that will help theaters fill gaps left by the ongoing strike by Hollywood actors . Hopes for a quick end to the work stoppage were dashed last week when labor negotiations broke down. The National Association of Theatre Owners said a survey of 6,000 moviegoers found that 72% want to see more concerts films in cinemas.

        "text": " The government\u2019s case at trial against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is, so far, heavy on what his top executives claim the crypto entrepreneur said, thought, and did.\u00a0It is less reliant on indisputable proof of Bankman-Fried\u2019s own words. Scant documentation left by Bankman-Fried is one hurdle facing prosecutors as they walk jurors through the downfall of the once-booming crypto exchange, trying to prove that the former CEO intended to defraud customers, investors, and lenders. They allege that Bankman-Fried deliberately stole funds that belonged to FTX customers, secretly lending the assets to his crypto trading firm Alameda Research. Bankman-Fried\u2019s defense team is insisting the opposite is true. \"Sam didn\u2019t intend to steal from anyone,\" Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorney Mark Cohen said during opening statements. To convict Bankman-Fried, all 12 jurors must find that prosecutors proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, what was in Bankman-Fried\u2019s mind. Cohen said Bankman-Fried believed in \"good faith\" that Alameda could use FTX\u2019s funds \"provided there were sufficient assets for them to be paid back.\" Over the last two weeks prosecutors have introduced damning testimony from Bankman-Fried\u2019s most senior former executives. The witnesses include Caroline Ellison, who was the CEO of Alameda and Bankman-Fried\u2019s onetime girlfriend, as well as Gary Wang, who was the co-founder of FTX and Alameda. Ellison and Wang, who pleaded guilty in hopes of receiving lighter sentences, told jurors they committed multiple felonies alongside their former boss, testifying that they knew at the time that Alameda\u2019s so-called loans from FTX were illegal. To corroborate or discount the witnesses\u2019 claims, jurors so far have a fragmented set of preserved messaging app screen grabs, spreadsheets, and Google documents to evaluate. Some do contain Bankman-Fried\u2019s own words, mostly in Twitter posts. But according to Ellison, Wang and other former FTX employees, Bankman-Fried limited records, by design. He omitted sensitive company information from emails, messages, and other records, and instructed his staff to use self-deleting messaging apps. \"He said that we should think about the New York Times test, meaning that anything we put in writing on Slack should be something we are comfortable seeing on the front page of the New York Times,\" Ellison testified on Wednesday. Here is a closer look at how prosecutors are trying to use the limited examples of Bankman-Fried\u2019s own words to prove he intentionally put FTX customer funds in jeopardy and duped investors and lenders into backing his companies: One source of evidence offered by the government that features Bankman-Fried\u2019s own words is his Twitter feed. The former crypto star was a prolific Tweeter before, during, and after FTX\u2019s collapse. On November 7, 2022, as FTX customer withdrawals spiked, Bankman-Fried wrote: \"FTX is fine. Assets are fine,\" and that the exchange had \"enough to cover all client holdings.\" Wang testified that at the time of the Tweet, Bankman-Fried knew the exchange carried an $8 billion shortfall in customer assets. \"FTX was not fine,\" Wang said. \"Assets were not fine.\" Wang, however, admitted on cross examination that in a November 17 meeting with prosecutors he said the tweet was true because Bankman-Fried was careful to say that FTX was solvent but not liquid. \"I said that, amongst other things, yes.\" Prosecutors and Bankman-Fried disagree about whether Alameda could legally use FTX customer funds. The defendant\u2019s lawyer claims Bankman-Fried believed Alameda could do so, as long as it had the assets to pay the money back, while prosecutors say the practice was nonetheless criminal. So far, few records shown at trial indicate what Bankman-Fried believed about the practice. Some witnesses recounted conversations they say they had with Bankman-Fried on the subject. One was Wang, the co-founder of FTX, who testified that he never thought Alameda was entitled to spend the exchange\u2019s customer funds. In the company\u2019s first year, he said, Bankman-Fried told him Alameda\u2019s use of FTX funds was OK so long as the amount didn\u2019t exceed FTX\u2019s annual revenue of roughly $150 million. Between late 2019 to early 2020, Wang said, Bankman-Fried knew Alameda\u2019s debt to FTX totaled $200 million. That\u2019s when he said the defendant suggested adding a digital token Bankman-Fried created called FTT and other assets held in Alameda\u2019s dozens of FTX subaccounts to prop up the balance sheet. Another witness, FTX venture capital investor Matthew Huang, said Bankman-Fried provided him with a presentation in early 2021 offering reassurances about the sanctity of the FTX deposits and the exchange\u2019s relationship with Alameda. The presentation stated that FTX acted as a custodian for its customers\u2019 deposits. Prosecutors showed jurors a copy of this presentation. \"Our general understanding was that the platform would take in deposits and hold onto them while their customers could trade on the platform,\" Huang said. \"And if those customers wanted those funds back that they could withdraw them.\" Huang said he also raised concerns about Alameda having special privileges on the exchange in an email to Bankman-Fried. Bankman-Fried addressed the concerns in a separate meeting, he said, stating there was no preferential treatment for Alameda. Huang said Bankman-Fried confirmed Alameda was FTX\u2019s largest trader on the platform, though omitted that the company was exempt from the collateral requirements imposed on other FTX account holders, and could carry negative balances against the exchange. After Alameda had taken billions in customer funds from FTX, witnesses say it became less likely it could pay that money back. They say Bankman-Fried was aware of these concerns. One piece of evidence cited by Ellison and shown to the jury was a May 2022 Google document she created called \"worries and questions.\" Ellison said she shared the document with Bankman-Fried because she was concerned about showing Alameda\u2019s financials to its lenders. At the time, Ellison said, Alameda was heavily invested in declining cryptocurrencies. That was significantly reducing Alameda\u2019s assets, and therefore its ability to return FTX customer funds. Bankman-Fried added a comment to the document, writing: \"Yup and could get worse.\" Ellison and Wang testified that in the following months, as lenders demanded repayment, they continued to worry that Alameda lacked enough liquid assets to return FTX funds. Wang said Bankman-Fried told him and Ellison at a meeting that Alameda could go ahead and repay Alameda\u2019s lenders. The only way Alameda could do that, they claimed, was to use FTX customer funds. Ellison corroborated Wang\u2019s testimony, claiming that Bankman-Fried directed her to take billions of dollars in FTX customer deposits to repay the Alameda loans. Bankman-Fried, she said, also instructed her to use FTX customer funds to place speculative cryptocurrency trades and send misleading balance sheets to Alameda\u2019s lenders, making the company\u2019s financials look less risky than they actually were. \u201cHe directed me to commit these crimes,\" Ellison said. Those multi-billion dollar directives didn\u2019t appear in emails, chats, or other evidence. However, prosecutors did introduce a Google document created by Bankman-Fried and shared with Wang and another FTX executive in September 2022 that discussed whether to shut down Alameda in light of a soon-to-be-published Bloomberg story that questioned the close relationship between the hedge fund and the exchange. \"I think it might be time for Alameda Research to be shut down,\" he wrote. One reason, he added, was that \"a PR hit from Alameda and FTX both existing is really large.\" Click here for the latest crypto news, updates, values, prices, and more related to bitcoin, ethereum, dogecoin, DeFi, and NFTs Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "text": " (Adds finance minister comment) By Steven Scheer and Ari Rabinovitch JERUSALEM, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza will have an impact on the budget but it will be manageable since the country entered the conflict with a very solid fiscal position, Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron said on Sunday. In a speech to a G30 panel, Yaron said it was difficult at this time to put exact numbers on how the budget may be affected by the conflict. \"But there is no doubt this war will have fiscal implications that will depend on its intensity and duration,\" he said in published remarks. \"However, with the appropriate budget adjustments, ones that I believe are manageable, there should be no major changes to our fundamental fiscal position.\" He noted that Israel entered this war with a very solid fiscal position - a debt-to-GDP ratio just below 60% and a budget deficit of around 1.5% of GDP with similar projections for 2024. \"Past experience has demonstrated the resilience of Israel's public finances to military conflicts,\" Yaron said, adding that in previous conflicts over the last 30 years, the government was able to absorb the cost of additional military and civilian support within responsible fiscal frameworks and \"returning rapidly to a declining debt-to-GDP ratio on the back of strong rebounds of the domestic economy.\" Israel has vowed to annihilate the militant group Hamas in retaliation for a rampage by its fighters in Israeli towns eight days ago in which its militants shot men, women and children and seized hostages in the worst attack on civilians in the country's history. Yaron said there will be an effect on real economic activity but that Israel's economy \"is strong and stable (and) has robust and healthy economic foundations.\" \"The Israeli economy has known how to function and to recover from difficult periods in the past and to return to prosperity rapidly,\" he said, pointing to the Covid pandemic. Later, at a news conference, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich echoed Yaron's comments that Israel's economy was strong and is able to support all combat efforts. \"I gave an unequivocal directive that there is no budget limit regarding the war requirements of the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) and the security forces, and in assisting the survivors of the massacre,\" Smotrich said, adding that he was changing budgetary priorities in the 2023 and 2024 state budgets. The central bank, Yaron noted, was using a variety of policy tools to assure the continuing functioning of the markets. The Bank of Israel said last week it will sell up to $30 billion of foreign currency in the open market, the central bank's first ever sale of foreign exchange, to maintain the shekel's stability during the war. It also will provide liquidity through swap mechanisms in the market of up to $15 billion. Yaron said Israel's forex reserves of some $200 billion \"provides us with ample capacity to support the Israeli economy.\" He added that the biggest risk to inflation in the past nine months and now even more so is the depreciation of the shekel. The inflation rate stood at 4.1% in August and it was too soon to tell how supply and demand dislocations will impact inflation. Yaron also called on governments to combat financial transactions by terror groups. \"Stop the money routes and sources of countries and organizations that sponsor terrorism, and act decisively to eliminate the financial flows that are harmful to ourselves and to our global system,\" he said.

        "text": " Note: A version of this article was published at TKer.co. Stocks ticked higher last week, with the S&P 500 rising 0.4% to close at 4,327.78. The index is now up 12.7% year to date, up 21% from its October 12, 2022 closing low of 3,577.03, and down 9.8% from its January 3, 2022 record closing high of 4,796.56. Q3 earnings season kicked off this past week on a bullish note, with big banks like JPMorgan and Citigroup announcing better-than-expected financial results. According to FactSet, analysts expect S&P 500 companies to report a second consecutive quarter of earnings growth following a brief earnings recession. Perhaps the most controversial assumption embedded in these earnings forecasts is the expectation that profit margins will expand again. Historically high profit margins have been a controversial issue in recent years. As inflation rates surged in 2021, analysts were convinced rising costs would crush profit margins. But the opposite happened: Profit margins actually rose to record levels. During this period, many companies were able to pass higher costs to their customers through higher prices. Combined with improved operating efficiencies, this dynamic led to record profits. It was a reminder that it\u2019s \"dangerous to underestimate Corporate America.\" Surprising to some, high profit margins have persisted. And after a modest dip in recent quarters, profit margin expansion resumed in Q2. How were margins in Q3, and what\u2019s management\u2019s outlook for margins in the quarters and years to come? Almost every major macroeconomic narrative in one way or another is reflected in margins. Demand: If customer demand is weak, companies may cut prices to move volume, which is bad for margins. If volumes fall, margins may also fall if companies can\u2019t quickly adjust costs. Inflation: If the unit cost of goods falls, then companies may benefit from a margin tailwind. However, companies would offset this tailwind if they also cut prices. Labor: If workers have leverage, they may demand higher wages, which could pressure margins if companies aren\u2019t able to pass those higher costs on to their customers. Capex, AI: If companies have been upgrading their equipment and workflows, the improved productivity should manifest as higher profit margins. Interest rates: Interest rates have been on the rise. If companies rely on short-term debt or they\u2019ve had to recently refinance long-term debt, then their interest expenses may be up, which should pressure net margins. But it\u2019s also worth remembering that many companies sit on a healthy amount of cash, which is likely generating an increasing amount of interest income. While a lot of attention is paid on earnings \"beats\" and \"misses,\" the role of profit margins in the bottom line results may be far more telling. There were a few notable data points and macroeconomic developments from last week to consider: Inflation is cooling. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in September was up 3.7% from a year ago. Adjusted for food and energy prices, core CPI was up 4.1%, the lowest since September 2021. On a month-over-month basis, CPI was up 0.4%, driven by a 1.5% rise in energy prices. Core CPI was up 0.3%. On an annualized basis, monthly core CPI was up 3.9%. On a three-month annualized basis, it was 3.1%. The bottom line is that while inflation rates have been trending lower, many measures continue to be above the Federal Reserve\u2019s target rate of 2%. Inflation expectations are mixed. The New York Fed\u2019s September Survey of Consumer Expectations was mixed. From their report: \"Median inflation expectations increased by 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points at the one- and three-year-ahead horizons to 3.7% and 3.0%, respectively. In contrast, median inflation expectations decreased by 0.2 percentage point to 2.8% at the five-year-ahead horizon.\" From the University of Michigan\u2019s October Survey of Consumers: \"Year-ahead inflation expectations rose from 3.2% last month to 3.8% this month. The current reading is the highest since May 2023 and remains well above the 2.3-3.0% range seen in the two years prior to the pandemic. Long-run inflation expectations edged up from 2.8% last month to 3.0% this month, again staying within the narrow 2.9-3.1% range for 25 of the last 27 months. Long-run inflation expectations remain elevated relative to the 2.2-2.6% range seen in the two years pre-pandemic.\" Gas prices fall. From AAA: \"Domestic pump prices maintained their daily decline despite the uncertainty rippling through the oil market in the days since Hamas terrorists attacked Israel. Oil prices have risen a few dollars per barrel this week, but that is far from the roughly $40 per barrel temporary spike following last year\u2019s Russian invasion of Ukraine. The critical difference is that Russia is a significant oil producer, while Israel and the Palestinian territories are not. The national average for a gallon of gas fell 12 cents since last week to $3.64.\" Small business optimism ticks lower. The NFIB\u2019s Small Business Optimism Index declined in September. Importantly, the more tangible \"hard\" components of the index continue to hold up much better than the more sentiment-oriented \"soft\" components. Keep in mind that during times of stress, soft data tends to be more exaggerated than actual hard data. Job switchers lose pay advantage. According to the Atlanta Fed\u2019s wage growth tracker, the gap wage growth between those who switch jobs and those who stay at their jobs continues to close. Job switchers saw 6.7% wage growth in the 12 months ending in September, whereas job stayers saw 5.4% growth during the period. Many workers are on strike. From BofA: \"Most strikes in 40 years could mean higher wages & lower margins: 420,000 US workers have gone on strike in 2023. The number could rise to 545,000, a 40-year record, if the UAW strikes expand. Direct and indirect labor costs account for 76% of company costs.\" Spending is holding up, according to credit card data. From BofA: \"Consumer spending has been fairly flat over the last two months. Seasonally adjusted total card spending rose 0.2% month-over-month, reversing the 0.2% decline in August. Total card spending per household was up 0.7% year-over-year in September, compared to 0.4% in August, according to Bank of America internal data.\" From JPMorgan: \"As of 06 Oct 2023, our Chase Consumer Card spending data (unadjusted) was 1.5% above the same day last year. Based on the Chase Consumer Card data through 06 Oct 2023, our estimate of the US Census September control measure of retail sales m/m is 0.21%.\" Mortgage rates continue to rise. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 7.57%, the highest level since December 2000. From Freddie Mac: \"For the fifth consecutive week, mortgage rates rose as ongoing market and geopolitical uncertainty continues to increase. The good news is that the economy and incomes continue to grow at a solid pace, but the housing market remains fraught with significant affordability constraints. As a result, purchase demand remains at a three-decade low.\" Unemployment claims flat. Initial claims for unemployment benefits stood at 207,000 during the week ending October 7, unchanged from the week prior. While this is up from a September 2022 low of 182,000, it continues to trend at levels associated with economic growth. More unprofitable firms, but they represent a small share of sales. From Goldman Sachs: \"The number of unprofitable firms has risen in recent decades, reaching almost 50% of all publicly-listed companies in 2022 (Exhibit 7, left).3The share of business activity that they account for is much smaller but still an economically meaningful 10% of total business revenues (Exhibit 7, right).\" Economists think a recession is unlikely. From WSJ: \"In the latest quarterly survey by The Wall Street Journal, business and academic economists lowered the probability of a recession within the next year, from 54% on average in July to a more optimistic 48%. That is the first time they have put the probability below 50% since the middle of last year.\" Near-term GDP growth estimates remain positive. The Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow model sees real GDP growth climbing at a 5.1% rate in Q3. We continue to get evidence that we could see a bullish \"Goldilocks\" soft landing scenario where inflation cools to manageable levels without the economy having to sink into recession. This comes as the Federal Reserve continues to employ very tight monetary policy in its ongoing effort to bring inflation down. While it\u2019s true that the Fed has taken a less hawkish tone in 2023 than in 2022, and that most economists agree that the final interest rate hike of the cycle has either already happened or is near, inflation still has to cool more and stay cool for a little while before the central bank is comfortable with price stability. So we should expect the central bank to keep monetary policy tight, which means we should be prepared for tight financial conditions (e.g., higher interest rates, tighter lending standards, and lower stock valuations) to linger. All this means monetary policy will be unfriendly to markets for the time being, and the risk the economy slips into a recession will be relatively elevated. At the same time, we also know that stocks are discounting mechanisms \u2014 meaning that prices will have bottomed before the Fed signals a major dovish turn in monetary policy. Also, it\u2019s important to remember that while recession risks may be elevated, consumers are coming from a very strong financial position. Unemployed people are getting jobs, and those with jobs are getting raises. Similarly, business finances are healthy as many corporations locked in low interest rates on their debt in recent years. Even as the threat of higher debt servicing costs looms, elevated profit margins give corporations room to absorb higher costs. At this point, any downturn is unlikely to turn into economic calamity, given that the financial health of consumers and businesses remains very strong. And as always, long-term investors should remember that recessions and bear markets are just part of the deal when you enter the stock market with the aim of generating long-term returns. While markets have had a pretty rough couple of years, the long-run outlook for stocks remains positive. Note: A version of this article was published at TKer.co. "

        "text": " (Adds quotes) By Lori Ewing MANCHESTER, England, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Leicester City earned their first ever point against Manchester United in the Women's Super League after holding on to draw 1-1 at Leigh Sports Village on Sunday. Willie Kirk's second-place side have seven points from three games, level with leaders Manchester City, who thrashed Bristol City 5-0, and also with title holders Chelsea who beat West Ham United 2-0 on Saturday. United are fifth on five points. Captain Aileen Whelan struck at the far post from a freekick in the 60th minute to give Leicester a surprise lead, having frustrated their hosts for an hour. However, defender Maya Le Tissier equalised seven minutes later when she headed home Katie Zelem's corner to the delight of the home fans. Leicester have been a revelation early this campaign, unbeaten in their first three games after a 10th-place finish last season. \"Most teams outside of the top four have that inferiority complex,\" said Kirk. \"Our players never believed in themselves in the first half.\" United were relentless in attack, narrowly missing two brilliant chances in first-half stoppage time. Hinata Miyazawa saw her shot cannon off the crossbar before Melvine Malard headed the rebound over, cradling her head in disbelief. United lost Gabby George early in the game with what appeared to be a serious injury, the defender immediately waving for help when she fell. \"It doesn't look like a good one,\" manager Marc Skinner said. \"It's something we're going to work on with Gabby but we will wait and see the final assessment.\" England goalkeeper Mary Earps was honoured before the game for her 100th appearance for United. Earps made news earlier in the week when Nike finally released her national team replica jersey after widespread criticism for not selling the popular Women's World Cup finalist's shirt before the tournament. The 30-year-old said in an Instagram post that the jersey sold out on Monday, the same day it was released. (Reporting by Lori Ewing Editing by Christian Radnedge)"

        "text": " By Nidal al-Mughrabi GAZA, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Health officials in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip have resorted to storing the bodies of Palestinians killed by Israeli air strikes in ice cream freezer trucks because moving them to hospitals is too risky and cemeteries are short of space. Israel has unleashed the fiercest bombardment on the Gaza Strip to hit back at the Palestinian militant group Hamas after it carried out the deadliest attack on Israel for decades. \u201cThe hospital morgue can only take 10 bodies, so we have brought in ice cream freezers from the ice cream factories in order to store the huge numbers of martyrs,\u201d said Dr. Yasser Ali of the Shuhada Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir Al-Balah. The freezer trucks, whose sides still show advertising images of smiling children enjoying ice cream cones, are normally used to make deliveries to supermarkets. Now they are makeshift morgues for victims of the devastating war between Hamas and the Israeli army. The Israeli military said on Sunday it would still allow Gazans to evacuate south ahead of an expected ground assault in retaliation for the attacks by eight days ago by Hamas gunmen, who killed 1,300 people in Israel. Authorities in Gaza said Israeli air strikes had killed more than 2,300 people, a quarter of them children, with nearly 10,000 wounded so far. Hospitals are running short of supplies and struggling to cope with growing numbers of wounded. Israel has vowed to annihilate Hamas after its fighters rampaged through Israeli towns on Oct. 7 shooting men, women and children and seizing hostages. That means the Gaza death toll will rise sharply. \u201cEven with these freezers, the number (of the dead) exceeds the capacity of this main morgue of the hospital, and alternative ones, and between 20 and 30 bodies are being kept in tents too,\u201d said Ali, as he opened the doors of the freezers to show the white-shrouded bodies inside. \u201cThe Gaza Strip is in crisis and if the war continues in this way we will not be able to bury the dead. The cemeteries are already full and we need new ones to bury the dead,\u201d Ali said. In Gaza City too, authorities were preparing mass graves, said the head of the Government Media Office, Salama Marouf. \u201cIn light of the large number of martyrs inside the morgues of Al-Shifa Hospital, whose relatives did not arrive to bury them, signs of change began to appear on the bodies,\" he said. \"And in light of the continued arrival of martyrs in their dozens as a result of the occupation\u2019s massacres, a mass grave has been prepared to bury approximately 100 martyrs in the emergency cemetery.\u201d (Writing by Michael Georgy; editing by Giles Elgood)"

        "text": " (Adds quotes by Sullivan in paragraphs 5, 22-23; US official 8; Iranian foreign minister 9-10; Israel-Lebanon clashes 11; deal over Rafah crossing 24-25, Graham quotes 28-29) By Nandita Bose and Katharine Jackson WASHINGTON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Top U.S. officials warned on Sunday that the war between Israel and militant group Hamas could escalate, as American warships headed to the area amid growing clashes on the country's northern border with Lebanon. Israel has unleashed a ferocious bombing campaign over Gaza in retaliation for unprecedented attacks inside Israel by Hamas eight days ago that killed some 1,300 Israelis, mostly civilians. Gaza authorities say more than 2,670 people have been killed there, a quarter of them children. Casualties are expected to rise as Israel prepares for a ground assault on the tiny, densely populated enclave that could start within days. The conflict has sent tensions soaring. \"There is a risk of an escalation of this conflict, the opening of a second front in the north and, of course, Iran's involvement,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CBS. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced deployment of a second aircraft carrier group late on Saturday, calling it a sign of \"our resolve to deter any state or non-state actor seeking to escalate this war.\" The aircraft carrier the Dwight Eisenhower will join a small fleet including the massive Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier in the eastern Mediterranean. \"Iran is the elephant in the room,\" a U.S. official briefed on the situation said about the increasing military presence. \"The carriers are accompanied by warships and attack planes. Every effort is being made to stop this from becoming a regional conflict.\" Iran Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian warned on Sunday his country could act, telling al Jazeera that it had conveyed a message to Israeli officials that \"if they do not cease their atrocities in Gaza, Iran cannot simply remain an observer.\" \"If the scope of the war expands, significant damages will also be inflicted upon America,\" he warned. Violence on Israel's northern border is already escalating. Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah fighters launched attacks on Israeli army posts and a northern border village on Sunday; Israel retaliated with strikes in Lebanon. The U.S. is urging Israel to hold off on its ground offensive to allow humanitarian efforts for Gaza's residents trapped in the area, several U.S. officials said. Sullivan discussed a new weapons package for Israel and Ukraine that would be \"significantly higher\" than the previously reported $2 billion. He told CBS that President Joe Biden planned to have intensive talks on the package this week with the U.S. Congress, which has been hobbled by Republicans' struggles to pick a new speaker of the House of Representatives. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, speaking in Tel Aviv on Sunday, said the U.S. Senate could move first to approve more funding for Israel. \"We're not waiting for the House (of Representatives),\" he said. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on Sunday he is traveling to the region with other senators in coming days to push continued negotiations between Saudi Arabia and Israel. Graham said he intended to introduce a bill that would \"allow military action by the United States in conjunction with Israel to knock Iran out of the oil business\" if Iran attacks Israel. HUMANITARIAN CRISIS U.S. government officials also said they are mobilizing to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, anticipating a brutal ground offensive. Israeli officials have made clear it will not be an easy or swift campaign. It faces the challenge that scores of hostages seized by Hamas on Oct. 7 could now be held in a warren of underground tunnels, which its soldiers must clear to destroy Hamas. Biden, in a message posted on X, formerly Twitter, said: \"We must not lose sight of the fact that the overwhelming majority of Palestinians had nothing to do with Hamas' appalling attacks, and are suffering as a result of them.\" The U.S. has appointed former ambassador to Turkey David Satterfield as a special envoy for Middle East humanitarian issues. His focus would be on the Gaza crisis, \"including work to facilitate the provision of life-saving assistance to the most vulnerable people and promote the safety of civilians,\" the State Department said. \"We're pushing Israel to delay any action on the ground,\" said one U.S. official briefed on the situation. Asked directly if the U.S. was pushing Israel to delay its ground war for civilians, Sullivan told NBC \"we are not interfering in their military planning or trying to give them instructions or requests specific to their military planning.\" However, he added, the U.S. is telling Israel any actions should follow the law of war, and that \"civilians should have a real opportunity to get to safety.\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday that the Egyptian-controlled border crossing into Gaza would reopen and the U.S. was working with Egypt, Israel and the United Nations to get assistance through it. Hundreds of tonnes of aid from several countries have been held up in Egypt's Sinai peninsula for days pending a deal for its safe delivery to Gaza and the evacuation of some foreign passport holders through the Rafah crossing. Sullivan told NBC, \"so far, we have not been able to get American citizens through the border crossing and I'm not aware of anyone else being able to get out at this time.\" He added that he wanted to make sure the civilian population that remained in Gaza had access to food, water and safe shelter, and in an interview with CNN said Israeli officials had recently \"turned the water pipe back on in southern Gaza.\" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told Reuters that the Israel assault on Gaza would be bloody. \"I expect urban warfare on steroids,\" he said. \"There will be cries from the international community for Israel to stand down, but I think it's imperative that we give Israel the time and space to destroy Hamas.\" (Reporting by Nandita Bose, Katharine Jackson, Christopher Bing, and Steve Holland in Washington; Writing by Raphael Satter; Editing by Heather Timmons, Bill Berkrot and Sandra Maler)"

Sporadic fire across the Israel-Lebanon border over the past week has raised concerns that fighting with Hamas militants in Gaza could escalate into a broader conflict. On Sunday afternoon sirens sounded across northern Israel, sending residents running for shelter, and the military said it intercepted five of nine rockets fired from Lebanon. It then responded with artillery fire at the area from where the rockets were launched. \"We have no interest in a war in the north. We don't want to escalate the situation,\" Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told reporters. \"If Hezbollah chooses the path of war, it will pay a very heavy price. Very heavy. But if it restrains itself, we will respect that and keep the situation as it is,\" Gallant said, noting that there had been exchanges of fire across the border.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the economy would show a contraction of 0.2%. Economic output in the world's No.2 copper producer was dragged down by a drop in activity in sectors such as farming, manufacturing, construction and transportation, INEI said. That performance was partly offset by an increase in mining activity, fishing and the energy sector, it added. The latest data meant that during the first eight months of this year, the Peruvian economy contracted by 0.58%, INEI said. A breakdown of the figures showed that manufacturing dipped by 4.11% year-on-year and construction by 9.57%. By contrast, the mining and hydrocarbon sector grew by 5.17%, while fishing posted a 49.14% jump, the figures showed. (Reporting by Vivian Sequera Writing by Dave Graham; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)"

        "text": " After weeks of Fed speak and rising yields driving stock action, corporate earnings will take center stage in the week ahead. Results from Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) will provide a look at how the financial sector is responding to the rising rate environment. Meanwhile, Tesla and Netflix will highlight the start of tech earnings. A September retail sales report is expected to show minor growth amid an otherwise quiet week for economic data. Recent economic data showed inflation cooling enough for the market to bet that the Fed won't\u00a0raise interest rates at its November meeting but stocks still struggled to find solid footing as rising geopolitical risks and the fallout from higher for longer interest rates continue to cloud the picture. In the past week, the Nasdaq (^IXIC) fell nearly 0.2% while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose almost 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) popped about 0.8%. Inflation data out last week showed cooling price increases under the surface. The data left markets optimistic on a rate pause in November as Fed officials expressed that higher yields could provide necessary monetary tightening and effectively take the place of another interest rate hike. But combined with a hot September jobs report, there isn't a broad consensus that the Fed is done hiking altogether. \"Continued strength in the labor market could lead to persistence in wage growth and forestall declines in consumption growth, which would leave price pressures elevated and growth above trend,\" Oxford Economics' team of economists wrote in a research note on Thursday. \"With the Fed committed to returning inflation back to its long-run target of 2%, this would raise the odds of rate increases this year, extend the duration of restrictive monetary policy, and increase the chances of a recession occurring down the road.\" The impact of the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes on corporate America are expected to once again be a key focus during third quarters earnings season. And at first reading, major financial institutions are holding up, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC) all reported higher profits during earnings releases on Friday. But JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon laid out risks ahead in the company's earnings release. \"US consumers and businesses generally remain healthy, although consumers are spending down their excess cash buffers,\" Dimon said before commenting on how rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could further cloud the economic picture. \"The war in Ukraine compounded by last week\u2019s attacks on Israel may have far-reaching impacts on energy and food markets, global trade, and geopolitical relationships,\" Dimon continued. \"This may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades.\" In the week ahead, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley (MS) will lead the earnings calendar for the financials sector. \"The disappointing thing is JPMorgan was the best last quarter and probably will be the best in terms of performance this quarter,\" Dave Ellison, Hennessy Financial Funds manager, told Yahoo Finance live after JPMorgan reported results. \"So we're getting the best of bank earnings today and the rest is going to be not quite as exciting.\" Tesla recently missed Wall Street's estimates for third quarter deliveries, and margins remain a key concern for the electric vehicle maker. Margins have declined throughout 2023 as the company has used price cuts to ignite demand.  Morgan Stanley equity analyst Adam Jonas thinks margins likely fell to 17.5% from 18.2% in the period prior. After hosting a \"bull/bear lunch\" this week, Jonas said the read on Tesla's earnings \"skews cautious.\" \"Many are wondering if Tesla can grow earnings at all in fiscal year '24,\" Jonas wrote in a research note on Oct. 11. He added: \"The performance of Tesla stock following the print will likely be driven by comments on the forward outlook and how that may move consensus (up/down/neutral) for [fiscal year] '24.\" For Netflix, investors will be searching for details on recent developments at the company including rumors of a price hike, new details on the streamer's password sharing crackdown, and the success of the advertising tier. \"We believe pricing changes, slower than expected sub growth, anecdotal consumer checks, and viewership data indicate Netflix has slowed down, if not outright stopped, cracking down on password sharing,\" Jefferies equity analyst Andrew Uerkwitz wrote in a research note previewing earnings. \"This is likely due to re-focusing on getting timing, content, and pricing structures in a better position to increase borrower retention. We adjust our revenue model lower on new subscriber growth.\" In sum, Uerkwitz is \"looking for earnings to provide some answers.\" Broadly, the question facing investors this earnings season will be if company results can bring stocks out of the recent slump. Entering third quarter reports, the Street projected flat earnings compared to the same period a year prior. Some strategists believe the stronger-than-expected data could drive better-than-feared earnings. If that's the case, the next catalyst for stocks could take hold. \"We expect a better-than-feared earnings season and the SPX trading toward the top end of our range (4200-4600),\" Wells Fargo equity analyst Christopher Harvey wrote in a note to clients on Friday. But the \"upside will be hampered by interest rates,\" he added.

Willie Kirk's Leicester have seven points from three games, level with leaders Manchester City, who thrashed Bristol City 5-0, and also with title holders Chelsea who beat West Ham United 2-0 on Saturday. United are fifth on five points. Captain Aileen Whelan struck at the far post from a freekick in the 60th minute to give Leicester a surprise lead, having frustrated their hosts for an hour. However, defender Maya Le Tissier equalised seven minutes later when she headed home Katie Zelem's corner to the delight of the home fans. United were relentless in attack, narrowly missing two brilliant chances in first-half stoppage time. Hinata Miyazawa saw her shot cannon off the crossbar before Melvine Malard headed the rebound over, cradling her head in disbelief. England goalkeeper Mary Earps was honoured before the game for her 100th appearance for United. Earps made news earlier in the week when Nike finally released her national team replica jersey after widespread criticism for not selling the popular Women's World Cup finalist's shirt before the tournament. The 30-year-old said in an Instagram post that the jersey sold out on Monday, the same day it was released. (Reporting by Lori Ewing Editing by Christian Radnedge)"

        "text": " (Updates with quote from Noboa, electoral council) By Alexandra Valencia and Yury Garcia QUITO/GUAYAQUIL, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Ecuadoreans voted on Sunday to choose their next president, weighing pledges to improve the economy and control a spiraling security situation from a businessman who is heir to a banana fortune and a leftist who would be the country's first woman leader. Voters' top concerns largely center on the economy, which has struggled since the coronavirus pandemic and motivated many thousands of Ecuadoreans to migrate, and rising crime, including increases in murders, robberies and prison riots. The violence, which the outgoing government blames on drug gangs, reached a crescendo during the campaign with the murder of anti-corruption candidate Fernando Villavicencio, who was shot dead while leaving a Quito campaign event in August. Business scion Daniel Noboa, 35, has led recent polling, but at least two surveys placed him and Luisa Gonzalez, a protege of former President Rafael Correa, within the margin of error. Gonzalez, a 45-year-old former lawmaker, won 34% of the vote in a first round. She voted early on Sunday in Canuto, surrounded by heavy security. \"We are confident that the Ecuadorean people will vote with memory, heart, for a country with dignity and rights,\" Gonzalez said as she left her polling place. Gonzalez has said she would bring back the popular social spending that characterized Correa's decade in power, pledging free medicine, increased worker protections and direct aid to those in need. She also promised to use $2.5 billion from international reserves to shore up the economy. \"Right now we don't have social or economic stability. I worry about the future of my children,\" said Gonzalez voter Erika Granja, 43, in southern Guayaquil. \"I work every day for them and for them I want a better country,\" she said, adding that recent governments have \"left the country in pieces.\" Noboa, also an ex-lawmaker who has promised job creation - especially for young people - was a surprise entrant to the run-off, winning 23% in the first round. He is the son of multimillionaire banana magnate Alvaro Noboa, who himself ran unsuccessfully for president numerous times. \"The people want zero impunity, the people want progress, the people want jobs and young people want hope,\" Noboa said after casting his ballot in Santa Elena. \"We need the hope of a prepared candidate and (Noboa) is that,\" said Guayaquil university student Estefano Ruales, 25. \"We need the hope that he takes the correct path to improve the situation in our Ecuador.\" His taxi driver father was murdered during a robbery seven months ago, Ruales said, and he fears a Gonzalez victory would worsen insecurity. TIGHT RACE The national electoral council said on Friday some 825 Ecuadoreans in Nicaragua, Russia, Belarus and Israel would not be able to vote either because of a lack of consular presence or war, in a move criticized by Correa on social media. Noboa's vice-presidential candidate Veronica Abad said she would be at the council monitoring voting reports. Nearly 45% of eligible Ecuadoreans had voted by 1 p.m. local time, council president Diana Atamaint told a press conference, adding authorities would look into a social media video showing a person marking multiple ballots in the province of Sucumbios. Outgoing President Guillermo Lasso called the election early to avoid impeachment on charges he disregarded warnings of embezzlement related to a contract at a state company. He has denied the charges. The winner will govern only from this December until May 2025, when the victor of regularly-scheduled elections will take office. Many voters were still undecided in the final days of the campaign, according to pollsters. A Noboa victory initially could be perceived as positive by investors, but longer-term the market outlook would depend on who he appoints to top jobs, said Zulfi Ali, portfolio manager for PGIM. \"The market is going to look very closely at the policies, the initial statements, and also the composition of the cabinet, especially in Noboa's case,\" Ali said. \"So while the first reaction is positive, because he's a pro-business candidate, pro-business and pro-markets can mean two different things.\" Gonzalez has said Correa would be her top economic advisor, while both candidates have said they would balance compliance with the terms of Ecuador's foreign debt with the needs of the population. On security, Gonzalez has pledged to build a new prison outside Guayaquil and take back the country from criminals, while Noboa has said the most dangerous convicts should be held on prison boats, and that he will use technology to fight crime. Both have pledged to beef up security at ports and airports, hot spots for drug smuggling. Gonzalez enjoys the backing of Correa's Citizens' Revolution party, while Noboa formed his own party, National Democratic Action. Both candidates have tried to woo young people during the campaign's final days. About a quarter of the 13 million Ecuadoreans obliged to vote are between the ages of 18 and 29. Polls opened at 7 a.m. local time and will close at 5 p.m. (2200 GMT). Noboa is expected to await the results in the seaside town of Olon, while Gonzalez has an event planned in Quito.

        "text": " If government regulators prevail against Google in the biggest U.S. antitrust trial in a quarter century, it's likely to unleash drastic changes that will undermine the dominance of a search engine that defines the internet for billions of people. As the 10-week trial probing Google's business practices nears its midway point, it's still too early to tell if U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta will side with the Justice Department and try to handcuff one of the world's most dominant tech companies. If Mehta rules that Google has been running an illegal monopoly in search, the punishment could open up new online avenues for consumers and businesses to explore in pursuit of information, entertainment and commerce. \u201cThe judge can compel Google to open the floodgates so more startups and third-party competitors can put greater competitive pressure on Google, which will create higher quality online services,\u201d said Luther Lowe, senior vice president of public policy at Yelp. The online business review site has been one of Google's harshest critics while spending more than a decade railing against a strategy that favors its own services in search results. Google's search engine earned its huge market share by almost instantaneously presenting people with helpful information culled from the billions of websites that have been indexed since former Stanford University graduate students Larry Page and Sergey Brin developed the technology during the late 1990s. In addition to its technological wizardry, Google also pays billions of dollars each year to ensure its search engine is the default choice for answering queries entered in the world's most popular smartphones and web browsers. These agreements don\u2019t preclude users from switching to a different search engine in their settings, but it\u2019s a tedious process that few people bother to navigate. This reality is why Google is willing to pay so much for the privileged position, according to the Justice Department. Google's payments for preeminent search placement \u2014 including an estimated $15 billion to $20 billion per year to Apple alone \u2014 are at the head of the Justice Department's case, making it probable the judge would prohibit them if he rules against Google. Should that happen, experts believe the most likely remedy in the U.S. would be a requirement for smartphones and web browsers to display a palette of different search engines during the setup process. That's something already being done in Europe, where all indications, so far, are that most people are still opting for Google. That could be because they believe Google truly is the best search engine \u2014 as Google argues in their defense \u2014 or they just trust the brand more than rival options such as Microsoft's Bing or the privacy-focused DuckDuckGo. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella asserted Google has an almost hypnotic hold on users while testifying earlier this month during the trial. \u201cYou get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\u201d Nadella said. He then added that the only way to break the habit is by changing the default choice. As long as a ruling doesn't exclude Google's rivals from paying to be the automatic search engine on smartphones and web browsers, Microsoft could buy the default position for Bing \u2014 an opportunity Nadella indicated he would seize. \u201cThere\u2019s defaults \u2014 the only thing that matter in terms of changing search behavior,\u201d Nadella testified. Florian Schaub, associate professor of information at the University of Michigan, believes the fairest outcome in the trial would an across-the-board ban on all default agreements between two companies. \u201cThe current environment is being shaped by an architecture that's designed by the big companies that control the space,\u201d Schaub said. \u201cWhat the government can do is inject some neutralism into this and give consumers some actual choices. If people still choose to use Google, that is at least a consumer choice, which would better than having people stick to a default because they are conditioned to that default.\u201d In his testimony during the trial, Apple executive Eddy Cue said the company has embraced Google as the preferred search engine on the iPhone and other products because it provides the best experience for its customers. That stance has raised speculation that if Apple is blocked from using Google as the default search engine on the iPhone, it might flex its muscle as the world's richest company to develop its own search technology. However, a blanket ban on default search agreements that have been highly profitable for Apple and other companies such as wireless provider Verizon could trigger unintended consequences, such as raising prices on other popular products. \"If Google is no longer paying big bucks to Apple and other companies, they might raise the prices for their devices,\" said David Olson, an associate professor for the Boston College Law School who is following the antitrust trial. \u201cI don't think they will be big, but we could see some price increases because Google has essentially been subsidizing the cost of devices like the iPhone.\u201d Another offshoot of a ban on default search agreements is that Google still could have a dominant advantage in search if people continue to proactively choose it and the company would have billions of dollars more to spend in other areas that it once devoted to deals that it really didn't need at all. \u201cGoogle must think they getting a great benefit from those default agreements, but maybe they're really not worth that much,\u201d Olson said. \u201cMaybe their cost/benefit analysis is off and they will wind up more money and just as much dominance. That would be ironic.\u201d Although the trial is focused on Google's search engine, a government victory could have more sweeping consequences across the technology industry if Mehta decided all default settings are anti-competitive and outlaws all defaults in the settings. \u201cIf one of the outcomes of the trial is that there needs to be more neutral choices, it wouldn't just affect Google on Android phones, it could also affect Apple and the iPhone,\u201d Schaub said. \u201cDoes it mean Google phones might have to offer (Apple's virtual assistant) Siri as an alternative to the Google Assistant? Or would Apple devices have to offer Google Assistant?\u201d A decision like that would open a crack in the digital wall that Apple has built around the iPhone to give its own software and certain pet products such as Siri exclusive access to the device's more than 1 billion users, setting the stage for another potential legal battle."

        "text": " By Byron Kaye SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian regulator has fined Elon Musk's social media platform X A$610,500 ($386,000) for failing to cooperate with a probe into anti-child abuse practices, a blow to a company that has struggled to keep advertisers amid complaints it is going soft on moderating content. The e-Safety Commission fined X, the platform Musk rebranded from Twitter, saying it failed to respond to questions including how long it took to respond to reports of child abuse material on the platform and the methods it used to detect it. Though small compared to the $44 billion Musk paid for the website in October 2022, the fine is a reputational hit for a company that has seen a continuous revenue decline as advertisers cut spending on a platform that has stopped most content moderation and reinstated thousands of banned accounts. Most recently the EU said it was investigating X for potential violation of its new tech rules after the platform was accused of failing to rein in disinformation in relation to Hamas's attack on Israel. \"If you've got answers to questions, if you're actually putting people, processes and technology in place to tackle illegal content at scale, and globally, and if it's your stated priority, it's pretty easy to say,\" Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said in an interview. \"The only reason I can see to fail to answer important questions about illegal content and conduct happening on platforms would be if you don't have answers,\" added Inman Grant, who was a public policy director for X until 2016. X closed its Australian office after Musk's buyout, so there was no local representative to respond to Reuters. A request for comment sent to the San Francisco-based company's media email address was not immediately answered. Under Australian laws that took effect in 2021, the regulator can compel internet companies to give information about their online safety practices or face a fine. If X refuses to pay the fine, the regulator can pursue the company in court, Grant said. After taking the company private, Musk said in a post that \"removing child exploitation is priority #1\". But the Australian regulator said that when it asked X how it prevented child grooming on the platform, X responded that it was \"not a service used by large numbers of young people\". X told the regulator available anti-grooming technology was \"not of sufficient capability or accuracy to be deployed on Twitter\". Inman Grant said the commission also issued a warning to Alphabet's Google for noncompliance with its request for information about handling of child abuse content, calling the search engine giant's responses to some questions \"generic\". Google said it had cooperated with the regulator and was disappointed by the warning. \"We remain committed to these efforts and collaborating constructively and in good faith with the e-Safety Commissioner, government and industry on the shared goal of keeping Australians safer online,\" said Google's director of government affairs and public policy for Australia, Lucinda Longcroft. X's noncompliance was more serious, the regulator said, including failure to answer questions about how long it took to respond to reports of child abuse, steps it took to detect child abuse in livestreams and its numbers of content moderation, safety and public policy staff. The company confirmed to the regulator that it had cut 80% of its workforce globally and has no public policy staff in Australia, compared to two before Musk's takeover. X told the regulator its proactive detection of child abuse material in public posts dropped after Musk took the company private. The company told the regulator it did not use tools to detect the material in private messages because \"the technology is still in development\", the regulator said.

        "text": " (Bloomberg) -- When Zhen Hua 15 \u2014 a heavy load cargo carrier sailing from the East China sea \u2014 unloaded at Vizhinjam port on Sunday, it did more than just setting down the site\u2019s first gigantic cranes. It also put India on the map for the world\u2019s biggest container ships. Most Read from Bloomberg Israel Latest: Army Says Over 600,000 Gazans Have Fled South US Pushes Bid to Avert Wider Israel War After Iran Warning Israel Latest: Biden and Abbas Talk as Gaza Invasion Nears Your Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas War Global Markets Stable as US Pushes to Contain Middle East War Located near the southernmost tip of the country, the Vizhinjam transshipment container port \u2014 the first of its kind in India \u2014 will allow the nation to grab a bigger slice of the international maritime trade currently dominated by China. It will also bolster its aspirations to be an alternative manufacturing hub by reducing logistics costs for cargo coming to and from the country. The new terminal, inaugurated on Sunday, is another feather in the cap of Gautam Adani\u2019s conglomerate, which faced a scathing short seller attack in January alleging corporate malfeasance \u2014 charges the Adani Group has denied. With a dominance that already spans ports, mines, airports and power utilities, Vizhinjam will further cement the billionaire\u2019s status as India\u2019s infrastructure king. The proximity to international shipping routes that account for 30% of global cargo traffic, and a natural channel that goes as much as 24 meters (79 feet) below the sea makes Vizhinjam an ideal hub for some of the world\u2019s biggest ships to call in. Until now, such ships had skipped India because its harbors weren\u2019t deep enough to handle the vessels, and docked instead at ports such as Colombo, Dubai and Singapore. Transshipment refers to transferring cargo from an original ship to another, bigger mother ship at a port on the way to the cargo\u2019s final destination. The much-awaited deep-sea port along Kerala\u2019s scenic coastline has been developed by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. in collaboration with the local state government. Adani Ports, India\u2019s largest private sector port operator with a 30% market share, is also developing Israel\u2019s Haifa port and plans to build a hub in Vietnam as part of its expanding global footprint. \u201cThe Indian ocean is 50% of sea trade,\u201d said Chakri Lokapriya, chief investment officer at TCG Asset Management Co. in Mumbai. \u201cThe Vizhinjam port with its natural advantages will improve operating margins for Adani Ports.\u201d Adani Ports will invest 200 billion rupees ($2.4 billion) in Vizhinjam Transhipment Terminal by 2030, Managing Director and Chief Executive Director Karan Adani said on Sunday. The project has already received an investment of 77 billion rupees under the first phase. The Vizhinjam project is strategically important for Adani Ports to gain a foothold in offering integrated supply-chain solutions to shipping lines, he said. The company has free cash flow of 70 billion to 80 billion rupees and will invest as much as 60 billion rupees every year to expand capacity, he said. Poor shipping connectivity has hindered India\u2019s integration into the global value chain, the Reserve Bank of India said in a 2022 report. India\u2019s container traffic was only 17 million twenty-foot equivalent units, or TEUs,in 2020 versus China\u2019s 245 million TEUs, according to a Feb. 7 statement from the ports ministry. The Narendra Modi-led government told parliament that may change soon. \u2018World\u2019s Factory\u2019 \u201cThe upcoming ports at Vizhinjam (Kerala) and Vadhavan (Maharashtra) have natural drafts in excess of 18 meters that would enable ultra large container and cargo vessels to call on the ports thereby boosting the efforts to make India the world\u2019s factory\u201d by improving the container and cargo traffic, the ministry said in the statement. Vizhinjam port, according to the Adani Ports website, will offer a quick turnaround of vessels including Megamax container ships. It will have a capacity of 1 million TEUs in the first phase at an investment of 77 billion rupees. About 6.2 million TEUs will be added in the subsequent phases. Receiving the first ship at Vizhinjam on Sunday was a spectacle in Kerala, with people flocking in large numbers to watch the docking. The communist-led regional government turned the event into a state-wide celebration, capitalizing on it as general elections loom. Still, running a transshipment container terminal comes with challenges, even for an experienced company such as Adani Ports, which has already faced fishermen protests at the site. A rival facility in Vallarpadam, operated by Dubai Ports World, has been dogged by procedural delays. The transshipment hub also needs to be connected by a network of road and rail links to warehouses and factories in the hinterland. A lack of such arterial support \u201ccan be the Waterloo\u201d for any port, said Mathew Antony, managing partner of Aditya Consulting, an advisory firm specializing in infrastructure, ports and logistics. Strategic Location The federal government is working on a plan called Maritime India Vision 2030 that seeks to develop world-class mega ports, transshipment hubs and modernize infrastructure at an estimated investment of 1.25 trillion rupees. As large ships become increasingly more vital to Europe and China trade, India can embed itself on that route, given its strategic location between the Suez Canal and the Strait of Malacca. Karan Adani said the port company is already in talks with two to three anchor shipping lines that would consider shifting their bases to Vizhinjam. \u201cThe size of vessels are increasing in the international trade route,\u201d he said. In the next decade, the average size of ships will be around 12,000-15,000 TEUs compared with 6,000-8,000 TEUs now, he said, adding Vizhinjam can handle ships of as much as 20,000 TEUs. India\u2019s current container traffic is less than 10% of China\u2019s but if the Vizhinjam port is able to lure more ships, it\u2019ll give India \u2014 and Adani Ports \u2014 a stronger footing in global maritime trade. --With assistance from Atul Prakash and Shamim Adam.

        "text": " (Bloomberg) -- A world economy struggling with record debt, expensive credit and increasingly dysfunctional or inadequate institutions now faces new dangers from war in the Middle East. Most Read from Bloomberg Israel Latest: Army Says Over 600,000 Gazans Have Fled South US Pushes Bid to Avert Wider Israel War After Iran Warning Israel Latest: Biden and Abbas Talk as Gaza Invasion Nears Your Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas War Global Markets Stable as US Pushes to Contain Middle East War The fighting between Israel and Hamas added significant risk to an already fragile economic outlook. The conflict overshadowed a marathon week of meetings among the financial and policy elite in Marrakech, Morocco led by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Calls for fresh climate funding and debt relief for poor nations, were already struggling to be heard. \u201cWe are living in a world with alarming challenges but at a time of intensifying polarization and extremes,\u201d World Bank President Ajay Banga said Friday, acknowledging \u201cunderstandable\u201d frustration in the Global South. \u201cThey\u2019re concerned promised resources will never manifest, they feel energy rules aren\u2019t applied universally, and they\u2019re worried a burgeoning generation will be locked into a prison of poverty.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at the key themes of the week: War The surprise Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas militants meant the latest Middle Eastern War was destined to dominate discussions. Through the early part of the week, with the scale of the conflict unclear and the market reaction relatively muted, there was a sense that perhaps the world economy would escape major damage. \u201cWe\u2019re monitoring potential economic impacts from the crisis, but I\u2019m not really thinking of that as a major likely driver of the global economic outlook,\u201d US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Wednesday. As the meetings continued, Israel\u2019s call for an evacuation of civilians in Gaza city, the threat of a possible new front in the north and protests flaring in the region added to concerns it would broaden and the economic fallout worsen. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters that \u201cgeopolitical risks are the most significant risk for the world economy now,\u201d a sentiment that grew as the days ticked by. Yet when it came time for the world\u2019s top finance officials to issue their consensus communique on the global outlook, there was no direct mention of the Israel-Hamas War \u2014 the very event that had so dominated the narrative. It\u2019s just the latest illustration of how the Group of 20, which bills itself as the \u201cthe premier forum for international economic cooperation\u201d is struggling for relevancy in a fragmenting world. The Group of Seven, representing the richest nations, was full-throated in its support of Israel, a contrast that reflects an underlying tension between between the so-called Global North and South. Wider War in Middle East Could Tip World Economy Into Recession Talk of War Dominates Annual Gathering of Global Finance Chiefs G-7 Condemns Hamas Attack and Pledges Solidarity With Israel Debt There was some incremental progress on debt relief \u2014 and a bit of a stumble when it came to the communications. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on Thursday said an accord between Zambia and its official creditors, co-led by China and France, had been signed. Moments later, officials had to clarify that the agreement was close, not inked. Meanwhile, an expected separate deal with Sri Lanka\u2019s official creditors never materialized. In a Bloomberg Television interview, Georgieva called for an acceleration in the deal making progress to help poorer nations in debt distress get help quicker. She said the global sovereign debt roundtable forum, which she helped create at the start of the year, is helping shorten the time needed to get deals done and unlock new funds. IMF Talks on Debt Deadlock Stuck Between China, Private Lenders IMF Bungles Zambia Deal Announcement by Front-Running Accord Sri Lanka Urges China to Share Debt Terms to Help Other Deals Funds When Africa last played host to the IMF and World Bank\u2019s annual meetings in 1973, then Bank President Robert McNamara urged rich nations to show more generosity toward the poor. Some 50 years on, Banga, the current president, is still urging. In a speech Friday, Banga asked the lender\u2019s members to make record contributions in the next funding round for its arm that helps the 75 poorest nations, warning of declining progress in the fight against poverty. The Biden administration has requested $2.25 billion for funding from Congress, a portion of which Treasury officials say could help \u201cunlock\u201d up to $25 billion in additional lending. And if other rich countries follow suit, the total effort, including private capital, could reach more than $100 billion. Even if that comes together, it won\u2019t match what\u2019s needed. An influential report co-lead by former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers sees $500 billion needed from international development lenders to help reach the extra $3 trillion required per year by 2030 for developing countries. Meanwhile, the IMF announced it closed the $3 billion funding gap to subsidize its Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust, allowing it can lend to the neediest countries at zero-interest. Africa Finds \u2018No Mercy\u2019 From Global Cash Crunch It Didn\u2019t Cause World Bank Head Seeks Record Help for Arm Aiding Poorest Nations Africa Is Front and Center at IMF as US-China Rivalry Heats Up Rates As officials met in Marrakech, traders were busy digesting the latest worrying readings on US inflation. Even against a backdrop of weakening global economic growth, the IMF called for central banks to keep policy tight until there\u2019s a durable easing in global price pressures. Yet attendees at the same time cautioned that the wholesale tightening also risks inflicting a shock to a world economy. \u201cDebt levels are at record high levels at the same time that we\u2019re in this higher-for-longer interest-rate environment,\u201d Gita Gopinath, the No. 2 official at the IMF, told a panel hosted by Bloomberg\u2019s Tom Keene. \u201cHigher for longer is also harder for longer for emerging markets,\u201d Joyce Chang, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s global research chair, said on the panel. Then there\u2019s the risk that a broadening of the conflict in the Middle East send oil prices racing higher, setting back the effort to wrestle inflation toward central banks\u2019 target zones. Higher-for-Longer Rates Worry World Bank as Debt Ripples Spread IMF Warns of Stubborn Inflation, Weak Global Growth in 2024 Fed\u2019s Bowman Says Higher Rates May Be Needed to Curb Inflation Reform The International Monetary Fund\u2019s top policy committee agreed Saturday to update its voting shares in the future to better reflect the economic heft of its members. But it\u2019s not quite as simple as just announcing that intention. The effort sets the US, the IMF\u2019s most-powerful voice, at odds with China and other emerging economies who are seeking larger shares. Any change in voting would need approval from US Congress, which is loathe to advance policies that increase the influence of its geopolitical rival China. Countries like Brazil, whose economies have grown significantly faster than those of developed nations, have long called for a re-division of quotas to reflect their heavier global economic heft. China, for example, accounts for about 18% of global output but holds just a 6% vote at the IMF, compared with Washington\u2019s 17% vote. \u201cIf we were going to do that, I think we would have to feel as if they were good, solid members of the IMF, living up to the obligations all of us have,\u201d said Yellen, referring to China and its perceived unwillingness to cooperate with the IMF, particularly around debt relief. Brazil Finance Minister Fernando Haddad said on Friday that he made clear to the IMF\u2019s Georgieva that while he understands the political reality in the US, failing to eventually update IMF voting shares would weaken the organization in the medium and long term. As for changing the voting share, the committee said the IMF executive board should develop by June 2025 \u201cpossible approaches as a guide for further quota realignment, including through a new quota formula.\u201d IMF Stymied Again by War With No Communique After Marathon Talks China Must Play by Rules to Get More IMF Sway, Villeroy Says Yellen Resists Pressure for Reform of IMF Voting Shares --With assistance from Alister Bull, Christopher Condon, Craig Stirling, Ekow Dontoh, Heng Xie, Jan-Henrik F\u00f6rster, Jana Randow, Kamil Kowalcze, Katherine Griffiths, Martha Beck, Michael Gunn, Mirette Magdy, Philip Aldrick, Souhail Karam, Toru Fujioka, Yujing Liu and Abeer Abu Omar.

        "text": " In a post-pandemic world, finding your place and purpose at work can be fraught. That\u2019s the perception from Michelle King, a workplace culture expert and author of the new book, \"How Work Works: The Subtle Science of Getting Ahead Without Losing Yourself.\" King has spent her two-decade career extensively researching office politics and is founder of The Culture Practice, a global consulting firm. \"Today we are less concerned with finding a path to the top of an organizational hierarchy and more concerned with finding the path to greater meaning in the workplace, and, by extension, life itself,\" she said. Recently, King discussed with Yahoo Finance her insights into the moves that can help people gain traction in today\u2019s rapidly changing workplace. Edited excerpts: The first thing is recognizing what matters to you at work. People have three basic needs. One is to feel competent in what they do. Another is to connect with other people, and to have a certain degree of freedom, or autonomy, over their work. To make your workplace work for you, you have to know how to meet those needs. The reality is we have to find ways to find our work meaningful beyond a set of tasks that we undertake. Find ways to pay it forward. The more you help your colleagues out, and the more you engage in small acts that are helpful, you will derive greater meaning at work. Find ways to understand and manage the informal side of work, which includes your interactions with others. Find ways to build meaningful, mutually beneficial relationships. Somewhere along the way it's become a little bit uncool to care about work. We see this with the quiet quitting phenomenon. We see this with the lazy girl job and now the snail girl job. All of these are popular trends to try and push back on work. What we miss is that we are our workplaces. It's a really sad state where there's this sense of \"I need to find a job where I can do the bare minimum.\" It's a backlash from employers because workplaces have such high rates of burnout, particularly for women. There are really high workloads, a lack of job clarity, and toxic workplace behaviors such as lack of inclusion. All of this points to the need for people to have greater connection and fulfillment at work. It's not about quietly quitting, it's actually about how do I derive greater meaning and fulfillment from work? When you leave your job, or at the end of your career, how will you feel? Most of us think about what we want to achieve, but we don't always think about how we want to feel. The root of the word for success in Latin means exodus. It means to exit. Success when you leave a job should be: What do you leave behind? What is the contribution you make beyond the tasks? When it comes to career success, it's about: Have I made a contribution beyond just a job title or a paycheck? Often we don't think about it until it's too late. You get to the end of your career having chased one job after another and can feel unfulfilled. Our definition of career success has changed because careers have. Increasingly careers are sort of boundary-less and self-managed. There isn't this linear career path. A title, or a salary, isn't enough. That\u2019s not going to cut it for most people. We all know somebody who's advanced at work, and they might be pretty average at their job. They might not have all the degrees or years of experience. And you wonder how they got that promotion. What research finds is that the most significant factor in determining whether somebody gets ahead at work is their ability to read the air. It\u2019s about understanding how to value the people you work with, how to manage your interactions with them, and how to meet their needs. It requires the ability to collaborate with others. Collaboration is king. For example, companies will often have organizational structures, but sitting alongside that are informal networks. The single most important thing you can do to future-proof your career is diversify your network. That means spending time, investing, connecting, and building relationships with people who don't look like you and don't share your background. Roughly 70% of jobs come through the informal network. If you're a hiring manager [and] you have a job vacancy, the first thing you're going to do is \u2014 even if you advertise it, even if you go through a formal process \u2014 you're going to reach out to people and say, \"Hey, do you know anybody?\" You're going to reach out and tap on the shoulders of people you trust and see if they're interested in the role. That's how the informal network works. Managing your own informal network should be the number one priority for everybody. Write a list right now of anyone you go to for informal information on how to do your job, advice at work, social support for when you're having a bad day or are struggling with something. Anyone who fits one or all of those categories is part of your informal network. And your job is to look at that list and think how different or similar is everybody on that list to me? Because if it's fairly similar, you need to diversify your network. When it comes to self-awareness, there can be a gap between how you see yourself in terms of your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and how other people experience it. We're in a bit of a weird space at the moment where people want to be authentic, but that's a very dangerous game. It's not about just going to work and being yourself. You have to manage the impact your behavior has on others. The higher up in organization you go, the less self-aware people are. They overestimate their positive impact. There's a real disconnect with people not understanding how their actions can negatively impact somebody else's lived experience of work. We must start to build people's self-awareness. The starting point for that is self-reflection. Reflecting is as simple as taking a few minutes each day to think about what you did at work and how you did it. This includes considering what you could do to improve rather than spending hours examining why you do what you do. For a 10- day period, take 15 minutes a day and ask yourself what questions. What worked? What didn't? What could I do differently? If you just spend about five minutes on each of those questions and you do that for 10 days, research finds you'll increase your self-awareness. At work, when you finish a presentation, a pitch, a client meeting, just turn to the person who you work with and say, what worked, what didn't, what could I do differently? Do that in the moment and use that as data as evidence to inform what you think you can improve on. People who ask why questions spend a huge amount of time in that sort of analysis paralysis place. They make up all sorts of stories about what's happening. You can externalize what's going on, so you don't really take accountability and change any of your behavior. It's about really finding meaning beyond the task. It\u2019s the importance of understanding why you do what you do, why it matters. When you answer those questions, you end up with your ikigai \u2014 your why for work. That is your north star that guides the decisions you make around your career.

        "text": " * Routes to southern Gaza unsafe * Nowhere to go from the south * Israel gears up for expected ground offensive (Adds comment from migrant in last two paras) By Nidal al-Mughrabi GAZA, Oct 15 (Reuters) - As Israel intensified air strikes on the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip and told residents to move south towards the border with Egypt, some like father of six Fadi Daloul thought that would be a safe option and gathered up his belongings. Palestinians are desperate to find a safe hiding place as the Israeli military prepares for what is expected to be a ground offensive in Gaza accompanied by relentless air strikes. The journey to the south is also fraught with risks as Israel hits back at Hamas after the Palestinian militant group launched a surprise attack on Israel, the bloodiest since the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. Israel has already unleashed the fiercest bombing ever on the impoverished narrow Gaza, one of the most densely populated areas in the world. And far worse is expected, prompting residents to seek safe shelter. Many Gazans have refused to leave their homes for the south, fearing a repeat of the \"Nakba\" or \"catastrophe\", when many Palestinians fled or were forced from their homes during the 1948 war that accompanied Israel's creation. Some 700,000 Palestinians, half the Arab population of what was British-ruled Palestine, were dispossessed and displaced, many spilling into neighbouring Arab states where they or many of their descendants remain. Many still live in refugee camps. Israel contests the assertion that it drove Palestinians out, saying it was attacked by five Arab states after its creation. For Daloul, the priority is the survival of his family as Israeli air strikes flatten buildings in Gaza - blockaded by both Israel and Egypt as a humanitarian crisis unfolds and hospitals run low on stocks of medicines. He is one of thousands of Palestinians who fled from the north of the Gaza Strip on Saturday, fearing what promises to be a ferocious ground invasion with relentless air strikes. \"We live under stress, we didn't monitor this thing before. It's huge. It's a huge threat. Children, as you see ... where should we take them?,\" he said. \"Especially when we left (our house), we saw on the way people burnt and hit by air strikes. Thank God we are safe and reached the south.\" The Israeli military was not immediately available for comment. Hamas has told people not to leave and says roads out are unsafe. It says dozens of people were killed in strikes on cars and trucks carrying refugees on Friday, which Reuters could not independently verify. Israel says Hamas is preventing people from leaving in order to use them as human shields, which Hamas denies. Gaza, a tiny coastal strip of land wedged between Israel in the north and east and Egypt to the southwest, is home to some 2.3 million people who have been living under a blockade since Hamas took control there in 2007. Israel said it kept two roads open to let people escape, but displaced Palestinians fleeing on that road said Israeli bombings of the eastern areas around that road never stopped. Two days ago 70 Palestinians were killed and 200 were wounded when Israeli planes bombed several vehicles carrying displaced Gazans, according to Hamas-run health ministry and Hamas official media. Reuters could not independently verify this claim. Daloul said it wasn't easy to leave his home when Israel started dropping pamphlets over Gaza telling people to leave. His family felt extreme anxiety, especially at night. There was a traffic jam. Some cars got bombed by air strikes. During the night, the children hugged me and started to cry and screamed: 'Save us, Save us'. \"How can we save them? When we left the house, we kissed the walls on our way out. This is migration and we don't know how long it will last. We hope that the world can see us, and see how we live. Look, we had a home, walls, and water, but now we live in a tent,\" he said. Israel says its evacuation order is a humanitarian gesture to protect residents while it roots out Hamas fighters. The United Nations says so many people cannot be safely moved within Gaza without causing a humanitarian disaster. Daloul's daughter Sahar said there is no place to hide from air strikes. \"All of our life is lived in misery. We don't know how to live. There is no one to save us or come after us. How will we live? How?,\" he said. An Israeli bombardment of Gaza faces both the Palestinians that stayed home and others who made the treacherous trip to the south knowing that Egypt is highly unlikely to open its borders. Speaking to Reuters by phone from Gaza, 20-year-old Gina, described the horror of moving on the main Salahudeen eastern road, one of two routes that lead to the southern areas. \"I was terrified, I thought I was about to die,\" said Gina, crying over the phone as she described the trip to the south. \"They told us to escape and then they bomb people on the road. My father drove back to Gaza City. He said if we are dying anyway, let's be at home in Gaza,\" she said. Even if its residents wanted to flee the enclave altogether, they have nowhere to go as the most obvious exit would be through Egypt, something Cairo rejects. Cairo, a frequent mediator between Israel and the Palestinians, always insists the two sides resolve conflicts within their borders, saying this is the only way Palestinians can secure their right to statehood. A witness said he saw mangled cars and a completely torched truck on the road to the south. Some people who had hoped the south would provide some relief have changed their minds and are heading north. \"I am taking my family back into Gaza. I can't continue to live in a school or outside my home, when no place is safe anyway, my home is better,\" said Abu Dawoud, a Gaza accountant. (Writing by Michael Georgy; editing by David Evans)"

        "text": " (Bloomberg) -- Emerging Asian central banks are turning to innovative ways to protect their currencies as fears over higher-for-longer US interest rates and rising global tensions drag down risk assets. Most Read from Bloomberg Israel Latest: Army Says Over 600,000 Gazans Have Fled South US Pushes Bid to Avert Wider Israel War After Iran Warning Israel Latest: Biden and Abbas Talk as Gaza Invasion Nears Your Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas War Global Markets Stable as US Pushes to Contain Middle East War Asian currencies are especially exposed to outflows as benchmark rates in the region are generally lower than their emerging peers, resulting in a wider differential with the US. Among some of the ways officials are countering that: Indian policymakers said this month they\u2019re looking to sell more bonds to soak up cash, which should bolster the rupee. Their Indonesian peers in September started issuing a new line of debt to attract inflows and underpin the currency. China is selling a record amount of local-currency sovereign debt offshore to raise yuan demand. Indonesia and India are issuing more of their higher-yielding bonds to encourage inflows, which \u201cis a new way where they can still support the currencies without having to use foreign-exchange reserves,\u201d said Eddie Cheung, a senior emerging markets strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong. \u201cI think that\u2019s playing it quite smart.\u201d The use of creative ways to support their currencies is one way out of the dilemma of having to choose between allowing a currency to weaken, burning through reserves, or raising rates and crimping economic growth. Bloomberg\u2019s dollar index has surged more than 6% from its July low as traders have boosted bets on higher Fed rates amid sticky inflation and robust US economic data. At the same time, the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict are pushing up oil prices, driving haven demand for the greenback. The outlook for Asia currencies is a big deal for global emerging-market indexes. The yuan, rupee and rupiah have a collective weighting of 45% in the MSCI EM Currency Index. China and India\u2019s government bonds make up a combined 22.2% of the JPMorgan Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets, according to a representative from the US bank. Depleting Stockpiles India\u2019s falling foreign-currency reserves suggest the central bank has been dipping into its stockpiles this year to bolster its currency. Policymakers took another step at their Oct. 6 meeting by announcing a potential bond-sale plan to mop up extra cash and support the rupee by pushing up yields. The measures employed by India so far have largely succeeded as the rupee has been virtually unchanged this year even as most of its emerging peers have weakened. Indonesia\u2019s central bank began selling so-called Bank Indonesia Rupiah Securities in mid-September with the goal of luring in more inflows. The bills, known as SRBI, allow global investors to take short-term currency risk exposure. They were introduced as the nation saw outflows of $1.1 billion from Indonesian bonds last month, the most in almost a year. \u2018Creative Complements\u2019 The measures from India and Indonesia \u201cmake for very creative complements to currency support that also take into consideration judicious use of FX reserves,\u201d said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Singapore. \u201cEspecially given that reserve drawdown can be a double-edged sword that suddenly accentuates a selloff if it presents worries about a possible cash-burn.\u201d China is employing a range of measures to buttress its currency. The government this week announced a 26 billion yuan ($3.6 billion) issue of yuan-denominated sovereign bonds for this quarter, boosting its 2023 total to a record 55 billion yuan. Investors see the main goal of the issuance is to support the yuan by raising demand for the currency. The People\u2019s Bank of China last month intervened in the offshore yuan market, increasing the cost for banks to borrow the currency from each other in Hong Kong to make it less attractive to bet against it. Hedging Issues Some of these measures come with their own costs. In China\u2019s case, investors who own the nation\u2019s bonds are finding it more difficult to hedge as cash rates increase. \u201cChina bonds were suddenly no longer attractive to us when the PBOC abruptly jacked up their offshore cash rates,\u201d said Robert Samson, co-head of global multi-asset at Nikko Asset Management in Singapore. \u201cIf you can\u2019t hedge it and you\u2019ve got concerns about the currency, I don\u2019t know how you own it.\u201d While the various creative measures don\u2019t totally replace the use of foreign-exchange reserves, they do help reduce the amount needed. Most emerging-market central banks have an import cover ratio \u2014 the number of months of imports that foreign reserves can cover \u2014 well above the traditional rule of thumb of three months. \u201cReserve adequacy isn\u2019t a concern across most of Asia,\u201d said Arindam Sandilya, head of emerging Asia local markets strategy at JPMorgan Chase Bank in Singapore. \u201cThere are variations across countries, but for the most part, they are well in excess of prudential norms.\u201d What to Watch China will release third-quarter GDP Wednesday, with economists expecting growth to decelerate to 4.5% year-on-year. Nation will also industrial production, retail sales and fixed asset investment figures the same day Bank Indonesia and Bank of Korea are both forecast to keep rates unchanged Thursday Malaysia, Thailand and Mexico all release foreign-reserves data next week, while Malaysia and Poland will publish inflation figures --With assistance from Subhadip Sircar, Karl Lester M.

        "text": " By Nandita Bose and Trevor Hunnicutt WASHINGTON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's 2024 re-election team and his party said on Sunday that they raised $71 million during the latest quarter, as the Democrat's age and low approval ratings remained a concern for many donors. The money raised is similar to the $72 million Biden and the Democratic Party raised in the prior quarter, though the April-to-June period was shorter by 25 days because Biden launched his campaign in late April. The summertime July-to-September period more than one year before the election is traditionally sluggish for raising money. The Democratic re-election effort had $91 million in cash on hand at the end of September, across several of the party's affiliated fundraising entities. Biden, 80, who fought doubts about his age in deciding to seek another four-year term in 2024, is grappling with polls showing concern about the president's age and decreased enthusiasm among Democratic voters. Biden's campaign, which is based in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, said it will use funds raised so far to hire staff, organize in competitive states and launch advertising campaigns. The campaign is expected to go on another hiring spree in the coming weeks and before year-end to start building out an operation to combat what top aides now view as their likely rival in the Nov. 5, 2024 election, Republican former President Donald Trump. By comparison, then-President Trump and the Republican National Committee raised $125 million in the third quarter of 2019 for their re-election effort. Former President Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee gathered $70 million in 2011, a figure Biden's latest would trail in inflation-adjusted terms. Fundraising sums announced by Biden's campaign cannot be directly compared with Republican rivals because they include party accounts controlled by Biden allies. Republicans have not yet picked a nominee and are spending some of their campaign funds on their fight against each other. The Biden campaign, along with other candidates, are required to submit more detailed financial records to the Federal Election Commission by later on Sunday. Earlier this month, Trump said his campaign raised over $45.5 million in the July-to-September quarter. His closest rival, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, reported raising $15 million during the same period. Trump's fundraising efforts have benefited from supporters who regard his four criminal indictments as politically motivated. Biden's popularity is near the lowest level of his presidency, with just 40% of Americans approving of his performance, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll this month. Biden has had to balance the rigors and travel demands of a campaign with a busy period in Washington, including a threatened government shutdown, a leaderless House of Representatives, an auto worker strike, natural disasters including the Hawaii wildfires, the Ukraine war, tensions with China and now the outbreak of war in Israel. His campaign, which has held more fundraising events for the wealthy than political rallies for the public, said it organized 75 fundraisers since launch, including 37 this quarter and that small-dollar \"grassroots\" fundraising made up approximately a third of the entire funds raised. Biden's campaign has focused its resources on boosting grassroots fundraising amid questions around their ability to bring in small-dollar donors, which often signal enthusiasm for a campaign. Such donors fueled Biden's record-shattering $1 billion haul in 2020 with $700 million coming from small online donations. Some of the moments that boosted online grassroots fundraising included a \"Meet the Presidents\" fundraising contest that raised nearly $2.5 million and \"Dark Brandon\" mugs and accompanying videos that generated $2 million in revenue since August.

        "text": " (Updates paragraph 2 with latest news, adds investor comments in paragraphs 17-19) By Matt Tracy and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed WASHINGTON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The Israeli-Hamas war has sharpened focus on rising geopolitical risks for financial markets, as investors wait to see if the conflict draws in other countries with the potential to drive up oil prices further and deal a fresh blow to the world economy. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Sunday to \"demolish Hamas\" as his military prepared ground operations in Gaza to root out the militant group, whose deadly rampage through Israeli border towns stunned the nation. Oil prices leapt nearly 6% on Friday, as investors priced in the possibility of a wider Middle East conflict. The first indicator of reaction to weekend developments will likely come when oil starts trading in Asia later on Sunday. \"It looks like we\u2019re headed for a massive ground invasion of Gaza and a large-scale loss of life,\" said Ben Cahill, senior fellow in the Energy Security and Climate Change Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). \"Anytime you have a conflict of this scale, you will have a market reaction.\" Market reaction in the past week has been relatively muted, though Israel's shekel currency took a big hit. \"I have no clue whether markets will remain relatively well behaved,\" said Erik Nielsen, group chief economics advisor at UniCredit. \"It almost certainly depends on whether this latest conflict remains localized or whether it escalates into a broader Middle Eastern war.\" The S&P 500 fell 0.5% on Friday. Safe-haven assets saw buying with gold up more than 3% on Friday and the U.S. dollar touching a one-week high. An expanding conflict would also likely cause inflation and, as a byproduct, interest rates around the world to accelerate further, said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at The Economic Outlook Group in Princeton, New Jersey. However, while inflation and rates in other countries will likely rise in this worst-case scenario, the United States could be the exception as foreign investors pour capital into what they deem a safe haven during global conflict, Baumohl noted. \"Interest rates could go down,\" he said. \"Expect the dollar to strengthen.\" In Europe, economists said the bar for another rate hike from the European Central Bank was high. The war between the Islamist group Hamas and Israel poses one of the most significant geopolitical risks to oil markets since Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year. \"If the Ukraine war taught us anything, it's not to underestimate the effect of geopolitics,\" Nomura European economist George Moran said on the bank's week ahead podcast. Other energy markets could be impacted, as seen in recent developments such as Chevron halting natural gas exports through a major subsea pipeline between Israel and Egypt. Rising oil prices are unlikely to have a significant impact on U.S. gas prices or consumer spending, analysts noted. The situation, however, bears monitoring, Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital, said. \"If all of a sudden either oil production is cut or oil transport is disrupted then that certainly creates problems not just for economies but for markets too,\" he said. Oil, shares of oil companies and commodities in general and gold in particular could serve as effective hedges for investors, Ablin said.

        "text": " Higher interest rates are lifting the fortunes of the nation\u2019s biggest banks. They aren\u2019t doing the same for the banks\u2019 customers. Earnings for JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC) all rose in the third quarter largely because high rates allowed them to rake in more interest income. Their scale allows them to leverage those rates by charging more for loans while holding down how much more they pay for deposits when compared to smaller rivals. These advantages show up in a key profitability metric known as net interest income, which measures the difference between what banks make on their loans and pay for their deposits. That number was up by sizable amounts at all three banks when compared to the same period a year ago. Together the lenders pulled in a record $50 billion, 18% more than the same period last year. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo even lifted their guidance for how much net interest income they would earn for the full year. Yet there were also clear signs that some of their borrowers are starting to struggle. JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo all increased the amount of loans they wrote off as losses. The combined charge-offs at those three banks totaled $3.98 billion, up 31% from the previous quarter and 105% from the same period a year ago. The total was the highest amount collectively for the three lenders since the early days of the pandemic, in the second quarter of 2020. At Citigroup, CEO Jane Fraser warned that US consumers were cutting back. \u201cContinued deceleration in spending indicates an increasingly cautious consumer,\u201d she said in a release. Affluent customers, she added, are accounting for almost all of the spending growth and weakness is showing among those with lower credit scores. Citi expects its credit card losses to reach pre-COVID levels by the end of the year. Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said even as the economy remains resilient \u201cwe are seeing the impact of the slowing economy with loan balances declining and charge-offs continuing to deteriorate modestly.\u201d Wells Fargo had charge-offs of $850 million, $622 million from consumer loans. The bank expects its net interest income to fall 3% from the third quarter to the fourth. \"Where Wells Fargo sees weaknesses,\" according to CFO Mike Santomassimo, is in commercial real estate, and \"I think we will see some loss pickup in that portfolio over time.\" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon struck a more somber tone. He said consumers and businesses \u201cgenerally remain healthy\u201d but consumers are spending down their excess cash buffers at a time when inflation risks remain elevated, increasing the possibility that interest rates could go even higher. Wars in Ukraine and Israel, he added, could also impact energy, food markets, global trade, and geopolitical relationships. \"This may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades,\" he said. He admitted that the bank has been \u201cover-earning on both net interest income and below normal credit costs, both of which will normalize over time.\u201d He told reporters there is a \u201cbig debate\u201d within the bank about when that normalization will happen. \u201cI personally think it will happen a little sooner than Jeremy,\u201d he said, referring to his CFO. Dimon, S&P Global Market Intelligence director for financial institutions research Nathan Stovall told Yahoo Finance on Friday, was \u201ctrying to throw out some caution.\u201d The bank, he added, knows credit costs are going to go up. \u201cThey are trying to prepare the Street that you could see tougher times ahead.\u201d One regional bank, PNC (PNC), demonstrated the problems that smaller lenders have navigating this period of higher rates. Its profits and revenue fell from a year ago, as did its net interest income. It expects net interest income to fall again in the fourth quarter when compared to the third. The Pittsburgh bank said it would reduce its staff by roughly 4%, saving $325 million. Several other regional banks, including Truist (TFC), have also eliminated jobs in recent months as they adjust to more uncertain economic conditions. PNC\u2019s stock fell 3% Friday while Citigroup's stock sold off slightly in the later part of the day. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo both rose. \"The inflection point,\" PNC CEO William Demchak said in response to a question about whether PNC's net interest income had reached a trough, \"I think is entirely dependent on what happens with the Fed in the coming year.\" Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.

        "text": " * Routes to southern Gaza unsafe * Nowhere to go from the south * Israel gears up for expected ground offensive By Nidal al-Mughrabi GAZA, Oct 15 (Reuters) - As Israel intensified air strikes on the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip and told residents to move south towards the border with Egypt, some like father of six Fadi Daloul thought that would be a safe option and gathered up his belongings. Palestinians are desperate to find a safe hiding place as the Israeli military prepares for what is expected to be a ground offensive in Gaza accompanied by relentless air strikes. The journey to the south is also fraught with risks as Israel hits back at Hamas after the Palestinian militant group launched a surprise attack on Israel, the bloodiest since the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. Israel has already unleashed the fiercest bombing ever on the impoverished narrow Gaza, one of the most densely populated areas in the world. And far worse is expected, prompting residents to seek safe shelter. Many Gazans have refused to leave their homes for the south, fearing a repeat of the \"Nakba\" or \"catastrophe\", when many Palestinians fled or were forced from their homes during the 1948 war that accompanied Israel's creation. Some 700,000 Palestinians, half the Arab population of what was British-ruled Palestine, were dispossessed and displaced, many spilling into neighbouring Arab states where they or many of their descendants remain. Many still live in refugee camps. Israel contests the assertion that it drove Palestinians out, saying it was attacked by five Arab states after its creation. For Daloul, the priority is the survival of his family as Israeli air strikes flatten buildings in Gaza - blockaded by both Israel and Egypt as a humanitarian crisis unfolds and hospitals run low on stocks of medicines. He is one of thousands of Palestinians who fled from the north of the Gaza Strip on Saturday, fearing what promises to be a ferocious ground invasion with relentless air strikes. \"We live under stress, we didn't monitor this thing before. It's huge. It's a huge threat. Children, as you see ... where should we take them?,\" he said. \"Especially when we left (our house), we saw on the way people burnt and hit by air strikes. Thank God we are safe and reached the south.\" The Israeli military was not immediately available for comment. Hamas has told people not to leave and says roads out are unsafe. It says dozens of people were killed in strikes on cars and trucks carrying refugees on Friday, which Reuters could not independently verify. Israel says Hamas is preventing people from leaving in order to use them as human shields, which Hamas denies. Gaza, a tiny coastal strip of land wedged between Israel in the north and east and Egypt to the southwest, is home to some 2.3 million people who have been living under a blockade since Hamas took control there in 2007. Israel said it kept two roads open to let people escape, but displaced Palestinians fleeing on that road said Israeli bombings of the eastern areas around that road never stopped. Two days ago 70 Palestinians were killed and 200 were wounded when Israeli planes bombed several vehicles carrying displaced Gazans, according to Hamas-run health ministry and Hamas official media. Reuters could not independently verify this claim. Daloul said it wasn't easy to leave his home when Israel started dropping pamphlets over Gaza telling people to leave. His family felt extreme anxiety, especially at night. There was a traffic jam. Some cars got bombed by air strikes. During the night, the children hugged me and started to cry and screamed: 'Save us, Save us'. \"How can we save them? When we left the house, we kissed the walls on our way out. This is migration and we don't know how long it will last. We hope that the world can see us, and see how we live. Look, we had a home, walls, and water, but now we live in a tent,\" he said. Israel says its evacuation order is a humanitarian gesture to protect residents while it roots out Hamas fighters. The United Nations says so many people cannot be safely moved within Gaza without causing a humanitarian disaster. Daloul's daughter Sahar said there is no place to hide from air strikes. \"All of our life is lived in misery. We don't know how to live. There is no one to save us or come after us. How will we live? How?,\" he said. An Israeli bombardment of Gaza faces both the Palestinians that stayed home and others who made the treacherous trip to the south knowing that Egypt is highly unlikely to open its borders. Speaking to Reuters by phone from Gaza, 20-year-old Gina, described the horror of moving on the main Salahudeen eastern road, one of two routes that lead to the southern areas. \"I was terrified, I thought I was about to die,\" said Gina, crying over the phone as she described the trip to the south. \"They told us to escape and then they bomb people on the road. My father drove back to Gaza City. He said if we are dying anyway, let's be at home in Gaza,\" she said. Even if its residents wanted to flee the enclave altogether, they have nowhere to go as the most obvious exit would be through Egypt, something Cairo rejects. Cairo, a frequent mediator between Israel and the Palestinians, always insists the two sides resolve conflicts within their borders, saying this is the only way Palestinians can secure their right to statehood.

The couple from Redmond, Washington, claim they had to pay the money because of their investment in an Indian company from which, as Charles Moore, 62, said in a sworn statement, they \u201chave never received a distribution, dividend, or other payment.\u201d But significant parts of the story they have told to reach this point seem at odds with public records.

The case is set for arguments on Dec. 5. The Moores are the latest example of plaintiffs whose lawsuits seem to simply be exercising their legal rights, but whose cases are backed by others with enormous amounts of money or a consequential social issue at stake. The Moores sought help from the anti-regulatory Competitive Enterprise Institute. Underscoring the case's importance at a recent Heritage Foundation event, lawyer Paul Clement said, \"The constitutionality of a wealth tax may well be decided in the context of this case.\u201d Details of the Moores' involvement with the company, initially called KisanKraft Machine Tools Private Limited, were first reported by Tax Notes, which caters to tax professionals. The public documents are filings with the Indian government. At issue in the case is a provision of the 2017 tax bill enacted by a Republican-controlled Congress and signed by then-President Donald Trump. The law applies to companies that are owned by Americans, but do their business in foreign countries. It imposes a one-time tax on investors' shares of profits that have not been passed along to them, in order to offset other tax benefits. The measure is expected to generate $340 billion in tax revenues. The Moores, along with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and conservative think tanks, contend that the provision violates the 16th Amendment, which allows the federal government to impose an income tax on Americans. The $15,000 tax bill was for the Moores' share of KisanKraft's profits. \"If you haven\u2019t received any income, how can you be required to pay income taxes?\u201d Charles Moore asks in a video posted by the Competitive Enterprise Institute. But far from being a passive investor with no influence over the company, Moore, who worked at Microsoft during his career in software development, served on KisanKraft's board of directors for five years. \u201cThe story the Moores told about Charles' involvement with KisanKraft is directly at odds with the fiduciary responsibilities of an individual holding a board seat for an Indian company,\u201d Mindy Herzfeld, a professor of tax practice at the University of Florida law school, wrote in Tax Notes. And there are other indications of Moore's more extensive involvement with KisanKraft than his testimony indicated. The company paid for his travel to India four times and he made at least two investments beyond the $40,000 stake he put up in 2006. Moore also was prepared to invest an another roughly $250,000. That money was ultimately returned by KisanKraft, along with 12% interest. One other inconsistency is that while the Moores say they jointly invested the money, only Charles Moore's name appears in company documents. The couple and their lawyers did not disclose any of that information in legal filings in three different federal courts, including the Supreme Court. \u201cThe original declaration on which the case is built is full of lies,\u201d said Reuven Avi-Yonah, an international tax expert at the University of Michigan law school. In a brief conversation with The Associated Press, Kathleen Moore said she and her husband would not discuss the case and referred questions to their lawyers. Andrew Grossman, the Moore's lead attorney, did not respond to messages seeking comment. The omissions, along with the Moores' failure to take advantage of other legal options that would have deferred, if not eliminated, their tax liability make Avi-Yonah and other experts in international tax law suspect the case was manufactured to get at a larger issue, the tax on billionaires that has been proposed by some prominent Democrats but never enacted. A wealth tax would apply not to the incomes of the very richest Americans, but their assets, like stock holdings, that now only get taxed when they are sold. \u201cThere really was no reason for the court to take it on, other than to send a signal to warn off the Congress from passing a billionaire tax,\" said Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Other provisions of the tax code could be upended by the court's decision, including measures relating to partnerships, limited liability companies and other business formations, Rosenthal said. Changes to those provisions also could affect some justices' finances. Chief Justice John Roberts holds a one-eighth interest worth up to $15,000 in an Irish partnership that owns a cottage in county Limerick, Ireland, and Justice Clarence Thomas' wife, Ginni, owns a limited liability company that generated between $50,000 and $100,000 in income last year from Nebraska real estate, according to the justices' financial disclosure forms. Two other recent Supreme Court cases advanced by conservative interests also raised questions about whether facts had been manipulated to get the disputes in front of the court. One of those involved a wedding website designer in Colorado who did not want to work with same-sex couples and a public high school football coach in Washington who wanted to pray on the field. Rosenthal said that \u201cthe ugly facts matter\u201d and that the justices could return the Moores' case to a lower court without ruling on it. Charles Moore said in his sworn statement that he agreed to invest in the company that was being formed by his friend and former colleague at Microsoft, Ravindra \u201cRavi\u201d Kumar Agrawal, because he liked the business plan and trusted his friend. \u201cMoreover, I thought KisanKraft was formed for a noble purpose and had the potential to improve the lives of small and marginal farmers in India,\u201d Moore said. The case had already kicked up ethical questions. Senate Democrats had asked Justice Samuel Alito to step aside from the case because of his interactions with David Rivkin, another lawyer who also is representing the Moores. The Democrats said Alito had cast doubt on his ability to judge the case fairly because he sat for four hours of Wall Street Journal opinion page interviews with an editor at the newspaper and Rivkin. Alito rejected the demands in a four-page statement issued by the court in which he said there \u201cis no valid reason\u201d for his recusal. ___ Associated Press writer Fatima Hussein contributed to this report. ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that Mindy Herzfeld is a professor of tax practice at the University of Florida law school, not director of the master's program in international tax."

Francis spoke as Israel was readying its troops for a ground assault in retaliation for unprecedented attacks it suffered when fighters rampaged through its towns shooting men, women and children and seizing hostages. \"So many have already died. Please, no more spilling of innocent blood either in the Holy Land or in Ukraine or anywhere else. Enough! Wars are always a defeat, always\" he said. Some 1,300 people were killed in the unexpected onslaught, while Gaza authorities said more than 2,300 people had died, a quarter of them children, and nearly 10,000 wounded as Israel responds with intense bombardment to the aggression. Francis called for prayers to counter \"the diabolical force of hate, terrorism and war\" and urged believers around the world to join Catholics in the Holy Land in a day of fasting and prayer for peace on Tuesday. On Friday the Vatican offered to mediate in the conflict. Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's Secretary of State, said the attack by Hamas on Israeli citizens was \"inhuman\". Referring to the Israeli response and the widely expected ground assault, Parolin said \"it is the right of those who are attacked to defend themselves, but even legitimate defence must respect the parameter of proportionality.\" (Reporting by Philip Pullella and Angelo Amante, Editing by Louise Heavens and Davidn Evans)"

Israel has vowed to annihilate Hamas in retaliation for a rampage in which its fighters stormed through Israeli towns a week ago, shooting civilians and seizing scores of hostages in the worst attack on civilians in Israel's history. Israel has faced heavy rocket barrages including in the south of the country, which has prompted the closure of the smaller Ashkelon port, which is the nearest terminal to Gaza. Ashdod port has imposed restrictions on the transport of hazardous materials which has meant slower transits. The port said in its latest statement posted on its website that it continued to operate as normal \"even under wartime\", adding that it was prepared to continue to supply Israel's economy with everything that was needed \"around the clock\" to ensure the population did not experience shortages. At least three cargo and dry bulk ships carrying cargo bound for Ashdod had stopped in waters nearby, with a further three vessels including an oil tanker and a container ship heading for the port, data from ship tracking and maritime analytics provider MarineTraffic showed on Sunday. Around 13 ships - comprising cargo, container and dry bulk vessels - were currently moored inside Ashdod port, according to MarineTraffic data. At least three laden dry bulk ships were waiting off Haifa in northern Israel, separate data showed. Haifa and Ashdod are Israel's biggest and most vital ports. The Port of Haifa, which handles multiple cargo segments including dry bulk goods, said on Sunday it was working continuously and also throughout the weekend. \"The activity has been reinforced to the maximum possible, within the operational and manpower limitations, in order to receive cargo of all types, including cargo that was diverted from the direction of Ashdod and unloaded at the Port of Haifa,\u201d it said in a statement. Leading container shipping line MSC said last week there were increased waiting times at Ashdod due to increased security checks and labour shortages and \"circumstances are subject to change at very short notice\" at Israeli ports. Israel's Economy Ministry said separately on Thursday there was a shortage on manpower making it harder to transport and replenish inventories due to higher consumption, although there was no shortage of supplies and urged people not to hoard food. \"There will be zero tolerance for price gouging,\" the ministry said. Wait times for ships docking in Israel have on average traditionally been much longer than in other ports. The government in recent years has been privatizing its ports and opening new ports in a bid to increase competition and efficiencies. Marine war insurance rates have surged more than ten fold since the attacks last week and some underwriters were reviewing cover provisions for Ashdod although Haifa remained unaffected, industry sources said. While Ashdod and Haifa ports account for just 0.4% of global container throughput, any expansion of hostilities beyond Israel's border could introduce risks to vital shipping chokepoints in the region, online logistics platform Container xChange said. \"The Suez Canal, a critical waterway for various commercial vessels, including container ships, may face disruptions,\" Container xChange CEO Christian Roeloffs said. \"Similarly, the Strait of Hormuz, a backbone for oil and gas shipping, could be affected. However, the extent of these effects will largely depend on the conflict's expansion and duration.\" The Marshall Islands registry, one of the world's top shipping flags, last week raised the security level for Israel's ports and its territorial waters to their highest. \"Threat of collateral damage to merchant vessels has increased significantly,\" the registry said in an advisory. \"Vessels with links to Israel or the United States may be under heightened threat of attack within Israeli territorial waters, the Arabian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, Gulf of Oman and Red Sea areas.\" (Reporting by Jonathan Saul and Ari Rabinovitch in Jerusalem; editing by David Evans and Louise Heavens)"

        "text": " (Adds polls opening in paragraph 12, quotes in paragraphs 16, 17) By Justyna Pawlak and Pola Grzanka WARSAW, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Poles vote on Sunday in a parliamentary election the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) hopes will earn it an unprecedented third term in office, while the opposition warns it could put the country on a path towards leaving the European Union. Opinion polls suggest PiS will come out ahead but could lose its majority amid intensifying discontent over its democratic record, which has cost Poland billions of euros in EU aid, and concerns over women's rights and the cost of living. With war raging in neighbouring Ukraine and a migrant crisis brewing, the EU and Washington are watching the vote closely, although both PiS and its mainstream opposition support NATO-member Poland's key role in providing military and logistical support to Kyiv. PiS has cast the election as a choice between security from unfettered migration, which it says its opponents support, and a creeping westernisation it sees as contrary to Poland's Catholic character. \"This election will show whether Poland will be governed by Poles, or by Berlin or Brussels,\" PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski told supporters at the party's last campaign rally on Friday. \"What will win is good, patriotic governance ... not the screaming and hatred that fill the media and which affect weaker minds,\" he said in Skarzysko Kamienna, a city in the PiS heartland in southeastern Poland. Since sweeping to power in 2015, the party has been accused of undermining democratic checks and balances, politicising the courts, using publicly owned media to push its own propaganda, and stirring up homophobia. PiS denies wrongdoing, or wanting to leave the EU, and says its reforms aim to make the country and its economy more fair while removing the last vestiges of communism. It has built its support on generous social handouts, which it says rival parties will stop. Its main rival, the liberal Civic Coalition (KO), led by former European Council president Donald Tusk, has campaigned on a pledge to undo PiS reforms, hold its leaders to account and resolve conflicts with Brussels over democratic rule. Tusk says his party would maintain social support. \"We need change if you care about fundamental values such as trust, accountability, tolerance to dominate public life again,\" Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, a senior KO official, told voters on Friday in Kalisz, in central Poland. JITTERS Voting started at 7 a.m. local time (0500 GMT) and will end at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT), with exit polls due to be released immediately afterwards. Political analysts say Poland could face a period of instability if PiS fails to secure a majority. One option would be to rely on lawmakers from the far-right Confederation party, whose support among younger voters jumped earlier this year on the back of promises to reduce taxes and limit support for Ukrainian refugees. The mainstream opposition might also end up with a majority, but it may take time before it has a turn at forming a government if PiS takes the top spot. \"It would be really sad for us, at least for me, if the current party were still in power, which would probably lead to Poland leaving the European Union,\" said Hanna Oktaba, a Polish citizen who emigrated to Mexico in the 1980s. \"We don't want this for the young generation ... if they wish to return to Poland. It would be a very poor option for them,\" she said in Mexico City. Regardless of who wins, credit rating agencies believe that pledges of higher social spending will be hard to reverse, raising questions about the public finances and leaving markets jittery. Foreign investors have pulled $2.3 billion from domestic government bonds and in July held less than 15% of outstanding bonds, the lowest level in well over a decade and below the historic average of 20%, JPMorgan calculations show.

        "text": " * U.S. must be ready for simultaneous wars - report says * Putin says war with Russia would be on a different level * Putin says: we all preparing for war, but want peace * Putin blames Washington for tensions with China (Recasts headline and lead) By Guy Faulconbridge MOSCOW, Oct 15 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday that suggestions the United States should prepare for a war against Russia and China were nonsense, and warned the West that any war against Russia would be on a whole different level to the conflict in Ukraine. A bipartisan panel appointed by the U.S. Congress said on Thursday that Washington must prepare for possible simultaneous wars with Moscow and Beijing by expanding its conventional forces, strengthening alliances and enhancing its nuclear weapons modernization programme. Putin, who is to visit China this week, said the United States had stoked tensions with Beijing by building the \"AUKUS\" security alliance of U.S., Australia and Britain and that Russia and China were not building a military alliance. Putin told Kremlin reporter Pavel Zarubin in a clip published on Sunday that thoughts of war between Russia and the United States were unhealthy but that if people were making such thoughts public they could not but cause concern to Moscow. \"I don't think these are healthy thoughts in the minds of healthy people, because to say that the United States is preparing for war with Russia, well we are all preparing for war because we follow the ancient principle: if you want peace, get ready for war,\" Putin said in a clip posted on Telegram. \"But we want peace,\" Putin said with a chuckle. \"Moreover, to fight with both Russia and China, it is nonsense - I don't think it is serious. I think they are just scaring each other.\" The deepening partnership between the rising superpower of China and Russia, the world's biggest nuclear power, is one of the most intriguing geopolitical developments of recent years - and one the West is watching with anxiety. The United States casts China as its biggest competitor and Russia as its biggest nation-state threat while U.S. President Joe Biden argues that this century will be defined by an existential contest with between democracies and autocracies. Putin cautioned that if the United States fought against Russia then it would be very different to the war in Ukraine that the Kremlin calls a special military operation. \"And if they want to fight with Russia then it will be a completely different war - it will not be carrying out a special military operation,\" Putin said. \"Look at the Middle East - is that a special military operation - can you compare them?\" \"If we talk about a war between great nuclear powers, then it would be a completely different story. I don't think that people in their right minds can think about such a thing, but if such a thought does come to them then it can only cause us to be wary.\" The United States says that both Russia and China are modernising their nuclear weapons arsenals and that China will likely have a stockpile of 1,500 nuclear warheads by 2035 if it continues with its current pace of nuclear buildup. Putin controls around 5,889 nuclear warheads as of 2023, compared with 5,244 controlled by Biden, according to the Federation of American Scientists. Of those, Russia has about 1,674 deployed strategic nuclear warheads while the United States has 1,670. (Editing by William Mallard and Hugh Lawson)"

        "text": " (Adds quotes, details) MOSCOW, Oct 15 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said Russian forces have bolstered their positions across the entire front line in Ukraine after what he said was the failure of Ukraine's counteroffensive this year. Putin's decision in 2022 to send tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine started a war which has left swathes of Ukraine devastated and hundreds of thousands of people dead or injured. Russia currently controls about 17.5% of Ukrainian territory and a four-month-old Ukrainian counteroffensive this year by Ukrainian forces has made almost no net territorial gains, according to Western analyses of the territory held by Russia. While Ukraine took back territory taken by Russia last year, the Ukrainian army has struggled to penetrate Russian lines which have been bolstered with mine fields and thousands of extra Russian troops. \"As for the counteroffensive, which is allegedly stalling, it has failed completely,\" Putin said in video remarks posted to social media by a Kremlin journalist Pavel Zarubin. \"The opposing side is preparing new active offensive operations. We see it and we know it,\" Putin said when asked about the battle for the eastern Ukrainian town of Avdiivka. Both Russia and the United States have described the upsurge of fighting around Avdiivka as a new Russian offensive. \"What is happening now along the entire length of the [line of] contact is called 'an active defence',\" Putin said. \"And our troops are improving their position at almost the entire area. Quite a large area.\" According to the Belfer Center at Harvard, Ukraine made a net gain of 8 square miles of territory the month to Oct. 10. The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution and Russia annexed Crimea, with Russian-backed forces fighting Ukraine's armed forces.

        "text": " (Adds Hezbolah attack in paragraphs 1-4, U.N. base hit by rocket 9, Israeli defence minister 10-12) JERUSALEM, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Lebanese Hezbollah fighters launched attacks on Israeli army posts and a northern border village on Sunday, and Israel retaliated with strikes in Lebanon as U.N. peacekeepers warned border clashes were escalating. Sporadic fire across the Israel-Lebanon border over the past week has raised concerns that fighting with Hamas militants in Gaza could escalate into a broader conflict. Hezbollah's attack on Shtula, a farming community that abuts the border fence, killed one person and wounded three others, the militant group and Israeli medics said, as the worst border-violence since a month-long war in 2006 entered its second week. Hezbollah also said it had targeted barracks in Israel's Hanita with guided missiles and said it had inflicted casualties on \"the enemy ranks\". The Israeli military said it had conducted strikes in Lebanon in retaliation and it declared a zone within 4 km (2 miles) of the Lebanese border off-limits to public access. Three security sources confirmed to Reuters that Israeli artillery had struck several areas in the south. Hamas' armed wing, Al Qassam Brigades, said it had fired 20 rockets from Lebanon on two Israeli settlements. United Nations peacekeeping force UNIFIL said its headquarters in south Lebanon had been hit by a rocket but no one was injured. It said it was working to determine where the projectile had come from. \"We continue to actively engage with authorities on both sides... but regrettably despite our efforts military escalation continues,\" it said in a statement. Israel's defence minister said on Sunday that Israel has no interest in waging war on its northern front and that if Hezbollah restrains itself then Israel will keep the situation along the border as it is. \"We have no interest in a war in the north. We don't want to escalate the situation,\" Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told reporters. \"If Hezbollah chooses the path of war, it will pay a very heavy price. Very heavy. But if it restrains itself, we will respect that and keep the situation as it is,\" Gallant said. Hezbollah has said it is ready to fight Israel and that it would not be swayed by calls from Arab states and foreign powers for it to stay on the sidelines. Sources say Hezbollah has designed its moves so far to be limited in scope, preventing a big spillover into Lebanon while keeping Israeli forces occupied.

The White House on Friday said North Korea recently provided Russia with a shipment of weapons, calling it a troubling development and raising concerns about the expanded military relationship between the two countries. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin met for a rare summit last month at which they discussed military matters, the war in Ukraine and possible Russian help for the secretive state's satellite programme. North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs since 2006. Those measures have unanimously been strengthened over the years, but the Security Councils is now deadlocked as China and Russia push for them to be eased to convince Pyongyang to return to denuclearization talks. Burmistrov told RIA that the risk of a nuclear conflict on the Korean Peninsula have grown sharply, partially as a result of Washington's actions. \"The rhetoric of North Korean officials about a hypothetical 'nuclear conflict' clearly illustrates the sharply increased risks that are provoked by the United States by drawing strategic assets to the peninsula,\" Burmistrov said.

The General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on Sunday its forces had repelled 15 Russian attacks near Avdiivka, Tonenke and Pervomaiske in the Donetsk region, while Russian forces launched heavy air strikes in the area. Oleh Sinehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region also in Ukraine's east, said on Sunday a 54-year-old woman and a 57-year-old man were killed and one woman injured in an overnight Russian air attack.

        "text": " WARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 Polish opposition leader Donald Tusk said that three opposition parties had sufficient votes to win the general election on Sunday after an exit poll projected that they had enough combined support to oust Law and Justice, the governing conservative nationalist party. The Ipsos exit poll suggested that the opposition together has likely won 248 seats in the 460-seat lower house of parliament, the Sejm. Law and Justice, according to the projection, obtained 200 seats, while the far-right Confederation got 12 seats. \u201cI am the happiest man on earth,\" Tusk said. \u201cDemocracy has won. Poland has won.\u201d Law and Justice leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski acknowledged that the outcome was uncertain. Kaczynski told supporters at his headquarters that his party\u2019s result, at nearly 37% of the vote, according to the exit poll, was a great success, but acknowledged it might not be able to keep power. \u201cThe question before us is whether this success will be able to be turned into another term of office of our government, and we don\u2019t know that yet. But we must have hope and we must also know that regardless of whether we are in power or in the opposition, we will implement this project in different ways,\u201d Kaczynski said. The exit poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points. Three opposition parties, Tusk's Civic Coalition, Third Way and the New Left, ran on separate tickets but with the same promises of seeking to oust Law and Justice and restore good ties with the European Union. Votes were still being counted and the state electoral commission says it expects to have final results by Tuesday morning. Many Poles feel it is the most important election since 1989, when a new democracy was born after decades of communism. At stake are the health of the nation\u2019s constitutional order, its legal stance on LGBTQ+ rights and abortion, and the foreign alliances of a country that has been a crucial ally to Ukraine after Russia launched its full-scale invasion. Law and Justice has eroded checks and balances to gain more control over state institutions, including the courts, public media and the electoral process itself. Support for the party has shrunk since the last election in 2019 amid high inflation, allegations of cronyism and bickering with European allies. Law and Justice won nearly 44% of the vote in 2019, but has been polling in recent weeks at more than 30%. Others see economic threats in the way the party has governed and believe that high social spending has helped to fuel inflation. There is also a high level of state ownership in the Polish economy, and the governing party has built up a system of patronage, handing out thousands of jobs and contracts to its loyalists. The EU, whose funding has driven much of the economic transformation, is withholding billions in funding to Poland over what it views as democratic erosion. The fate of Poland's relationship with Ukraine is also at stake. The Confederation party campaigned on an anti-Ukraine message, accusing the country of lacking gratitude to Poland for its help in Russia's war. While Poland has been a staunch ally of Ukraine and a transit hub for Western weapons, relations chilled over the Ukrainian grain that entered Poland\u2019s market. Around 29 million Poles from age 18 were eligible to vote. They were choosing 460 members of the lower house, or Sejm, and 100 for the Senate for four-year terms. A referendum on migration, the retirement age and other issues is being held simultaneously. Opposition groups oppose the referendum, accusing the government of seeking to tap into emotions. Some called on voters to boycott the referendum. More than 31,000 voting stations operated across Poland, while there were more than 400 voting stations abroad. In a sign of the emotions generated by the vote, more than 600,000 Poles registered to vote abroad. On Friday, the Foreign Ministry fired its spokesman after he said that not all the votes cast abroad could be counted before the deadline for submitting them, which would cause them to be invalidated. The ministry said he was dismissed for spreading \u201cfalse information.\u201d Individual parties need to get at least 5% of votes to win seats in parliament, while coalitions need at least 8% of votes."

        "text": " By Alexandra Valencia QUITO, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Ecuadoreans will choose their next president on Sunday, weighing pledges to improve the economy and control a spiraling security situation from a businessman who is heir to a banana fortune and a leftist who would be the country's first woman leader. Voters' top concerns largely center on the economy - which has struggled since the coronavirus pandemic and motivated many thousands of Ecuadoreans to migrate - and rising crime, including increases in murders, robberies and prison riots. The violence, which the outgoing government blames on drug gangs, reached a crescendo during the campaign with the murder of anti-corruption candidate Fernando Villavicencio, who was shot dead while leaving a Quito campaign event in August. Business scion Daniel Noboa, 35, has led recent polling, but at least two surveys put voting intention for him and Luisa Gonzalez, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of former President Rafael Correa, within the margin of error. Gonzalez, 45 and a former lawmaker, won 34% of the vote in a first round. She has said she would bring back the popular social spending which characterized Correa's decade in power, pledging free medicine, increased worker protections and direct aid to those in need. She also has promised to use $2.5 billion from international reserves to shore up the economy. Noboa, also an ex-lawmaker and who has promised job creation - especially for young people - was a surprise entrance to the run-off, winning 23% in the first round. He is the son of multimillionaire banana magnate Alvaro Noboa, who himself ran unsuccessfully for president numerous times. Outgoing President Guillermo Lasso called the election early to avoid impeachment on charges he disregarded warnings of embezzlement related to a contract at a state company. He has denied the charges. The winner will govern only between this December and May 2025, when the victor of regularly-scheduled elections will take office. TIGHT RACE Many voters were still undecided in the final days of the campaign, according to pollsters. A Noboa victory initially could be perceived as positive by investors, but longer-term market outlook would depend on who he appoints to top jobs, said Zulfi Ali, portfolio manager for PGIM. \"The market is going to look very closely at the policies, the initial statements, and also the composition of the cabinet, especially in Noboa's case,\" Ali said. \"So while the first reaction is positive, because he's a pro-business candidate, pro-business and pro-markets can mean two different things.\" Gonzalez has said Correa would be her top economic advisor, while both candidates have said they would balance compliance with the terms of Ecuador's foreign debt with the needs of the population. On security, Gonzalez has pledged to build a new prison outside Guayaquil and take back the country from criminals, while Noboa has said the most dangerous convicts should be held on prison boats and that he will use technology to fight crime. Both have pledged to beef up security at ports and airports, hot spots for drug smuggling. Gonzalez enjoys the robust backing of Correa's Citizens' Revolution party, while Noboa formed his own party, National Democratic Action. Both candidates have tried to woo young people during the campaign's final days. About a quarter of the 13 million Ecuadoreans obliged to vote are between the ages of 18 and 29.

        "text": " SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) \u2014 Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has so many fans and friends that he receives a $30 gift at the rate of one every three days, but because of his job he accepts none of them, and rarely even sees them. The second-term Democratic governor and multi-billionaire has been lavished with hundreds of gifts from around the world, ranging from a $950 bottle of Japanese whiskey to 35 cents: a quarter and dime, to be exact. The state\u2019s 25-year-old Gift Ban Act prohibits public employees such as Pritzker from accepting presents, with broad exceptions. Therefore, the high-priced hooch delivered compliments of the Japanese embassy and three bottles of tequila valued at $450 have remained untapped. \u201cI don\u2019t get to do that,\u201d Pritzker said at a stop in Springfield. \u201cI will say I like tequila, so that\u2019s why people will have given that to me, but there are a few other spirits that I like as well.\u201d Pricey bottles of alcohol are not the only gifts that Pritzker eschews. Most are stored in Springfield and Chicago, with a staff member responsible for thank-you notes. Together, they comprise 4 1/2 years of gratuities totaling 561 gifts valued at $16,890.14, according to a log provided to The Associated Press in response to a public records request. Perishable food is shared with office staff and visitors. The rest will eventually end up in an appropriate charitable home, gubernatorial spokesperson Jordan Abudayyeh said. A governor receives gifts for reasons you\u2019d expect: A gift bag when he visits a town or cuts a ribbon, a plaque from an advocacy group when he champions its cause. Promotion also plays a part. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards has sent king cake and beads to gin up interest in Mardi Gras, while authors seem to believe getting a copy of their latest work into Pritzker\u2019s hands will land it on the bestseller list. With a net worth of $3.5 billion as a Hyatt Hotel heir, Pritzker is not pining for much. But for those government employees who aren\u2019t among the nation\u2019s 326 richest people, according to Forbes magazine, the law prohibits accepting gifts from those who do or seek business with the state, who perform state-regulated activities and lobbyists. Acceptable presents from one source must not exceed $100 in a single year and no one may accept food or refreshments valued at more than $75 in a single day. Initiated in 1998 by the late U.S. Sen. Paul Simon, co-authored by then-first-term state Sen. Barack Obama and signed by Republican Gov. Jim Edgar, the Gift Ban Act was the first major ethics reform in Illinois since post-Watergate campaign-finance disclosure laws. \u201cIt\u2019s worked pretty well,\u201d said David Melton of the advocacy group Reform for Illinois. \u201cAs a general rule, they (public employees) are not allowed to accept gifts. That\u2019s the right approach.\u201d Based on value alone, Pritzker could accept the overwhelming majority of his gubernatorial gift pile. Each present, arriving at a rate of just under 10 a month, averages about $30. Beside the four bottles of luxurious liquor, there are only six gifts that are generally off limits, including a $200 Mondaine watch from the Swiss ambassador to the U.S. and a $120 potpourri of eco-friendly pet waste bags, biodegradable diaper bags, bamboo utensils and more from a citizen named Tiffany Kuhl. The COVID-19 crisis imbued the governor\u2019s admirers with generosity. From March 2020 through December 2021, Pritzker received 33 gifts specifically in appreciation of his pandemic protocol, including some that seemed more personal: handmade face-coverings, items with inspirational messages, selections of food and a Gov. Pritzker bobblehead from the National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum in Milwaukee. There also was \u201c2:30 p.m. Man,\u201d a painting of a smiling Pritzker in acrylic by SeungRi \u201cVictoria\u201d Park, a Chicago schoolteacher and artist. \u201cEvery day at 2:30, he showed up on my TV,\u201d said Park, referring to Pritzker\u2019s daily news conferences during the worst of the pandemic. \u201cI don\u2019t vote for any politicians, but I like him. I wanted to paint him. He reminded me of Buddha.\u201d Pritzker, the state\u2019s third Jewish governor, was not a spiritual leader to Park, but his message resonated. \u201cI don\u2019t go with religion and I don\u2019t go with politicians,\u201d said Park, who has remained free of COVID-19 in the 3 1/2 years since the coronavirus crept into Illinois. \u201cBut I go with science.\u201d As for the Governor\u2019s Gifts scorecard? Shirts: 54. Hats: 21. Mugs and totes: 23. Scarves: seven, including three maroon and gold Loyola University wraps. Pens and pencils: 8. Pins: 11 (plus one rolling pin). There were 188 books, 27 from the authors themselves, including former Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres. He is listed as sending a signed copy of his autobiography, though he died two years before Pritzker\u2019s election. Sidney Blumenthal, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton, sent his latest Abraham Lincoln biography, along with tequila and a stuffed pink flamingo. Consumer advocate Ralph Nader and his co-author, Mark Green, each sent a copy of \u201cWrecking America,\u201d a critique of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. Sometimes gifts come wrapped in the wrong potato chip bag, like when Pritzker stopped at a Freeport elementary school on June 6 and received from the Stephenson County Democratic Party two bags of Mrs. Fishers potato chips made in nearby Rockford, instead of the equally salty Mrs. Mike\u2019s potato chips manufactured in Freeport. Party chairperson Jody Coss cannot say for certain whether she grabbed the Freeport snack when she decided to add some hometown flavor to the governor\u2019s greeting. \u201cThe intention,\u201d Coss said sheepishly, \u201cwas to give him Mrs. Mike\u2019s.\u201d ___ Associated Press researcher Jennifer Farrar in New York contributed."

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has requested more information from Novavax on the shot, which targets the XBB variant, the company said. \"As part of the ongoing review process, EMA's human medicines committee (CHMP) has additional questions which we are answering expeditiously,\" Novavax said in an emailed statement to Reuters. The Financial Times, which first reported the news, said the EMA had questions on the potency of the vaccine's latest version, and that it is seeking to ensure its characteristics will be the same across different production sites. Novavax said it was working closely with the EMA and is looking forward to the recommendations from the regulator. The EMA did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. EMA director Emer Cooke said in September that it expected to decide on the use of the vaccine this month. The agency is expected to give its approval within four weeks, according to the FT report. Novavax said on Friday its updated COVID-19 vaccine was available at U.S. pharmacies such as CVS and Rite Aid , a week after it received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use in individuals aged 12 years and older.

The top U.S. diplomat arrived in Israel on Thursday - as it prepares a ground offensive in the Gaza Strip in retaliation for a deadly Hamas attack on civilians - and has also been to Qatar, Jordan, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. The conflict has raised international concern that it could spark a wider regional war as Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian warned on Sunday that \"the hands of all parties in the region are on the trigger.\" \"There's a determination in every country I went to, to make sure that this conflict doesn't spread,\" Blinken told reporters as he prepared to leave Cairo. \"They are using their own influence, their own relationships, to try to make sure that this doesn't happen.\" Binken met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh Sunday and then Egytian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Cairo, where he received a blunt assessment from Sisi of Israel's response to the Hamas attack that killed 1,300 people. \"The (Israeli) reaction went beyond the right to self-defence, turning into collective punishment for 2.3 million people in Gaza,\" Sisi told Blinken in televised remarks. Israel has vowed to annihilate Hamas - which controls the Gaza Strip - after its fighters stormed Israeli towns eight days ago, shooting men, women and children and seizing hostages in the worst attack on civilians in the country's history. Israeli jets and artillery have already subjected Gaza to the most intense bombardment it has ever seen, putting the enclave under total siege. Gaza authorities say more than 2,450 people have been killed. US ACTS TO DETER International diplomacy has been focused on preventing a spill over of the conflict - particularly into Lebanon. The United States has been specifically trying to deter Iran, which backs Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah group. Hezbollah and Israel have already been exchanging border fire over the past week. Blinken said the United States had made clear that state and non-state actors should not take advantage of the situation. \"We've backed up those words with concrete actions, including the deployment now of our two largest aircraft carrier battle groups to the region. That's not meant as a provocation, it's meant as a deterrent,\" he said. \"No one should do anything that could add fuel to the fire in any other place,\" Blinken added. Before departing for Cairo, Blinken described his talks with the Saudi crown prince, one of the most powerful leaders of the region, as \"very productive.\" A U.S. official said the meeting lasted for just under an hour. In the meeting, the crown prince stressed the need to find ways to stop the conflict, and respect international law, including by lifting the Israeli blockade on Gaza, Saudi state news agency SPA reported. Blinken said in Cairo that the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza would reopen. \"We are now very actively engaged with countries in the region, with the United Nations with Israel, to make sure to the best of our ability that people can get out of harm's way and that the assistance they need, the food and water and medicine, can get in,\" he said.

The violations by the global banks were over long periods, for nine months through May 2022 and five months through December 2021, respectively, and expected to result in record amounts of fines, the FSS said. The FSS said such violations, which came against authorities' efforts to provide a more favourable environment for foreign investors, should be prevented from recurring and that it would also look into practices at other similar investment banks.

        "text": " By Matt Tracy and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Israeli-Hamas war has sharpened focus on rising geopolitical risks for financial markets, as investors wait to see if the conflict draws in other countries with the potential to drive up oil prices further and deal a fresh blow to the world economy. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Sunday to \"demolish Hamas\" as his military prepared ground operations in Gaza to root out the militant group, whose deadly rampage through Israeli border towns stunned the nation. Oil prices leapt nearly 6% on Friday, as investors priced in the possibility of a wider Middle East conflict. The first indicator of reaction to weekend developments will likely come when oil starts trading in Asia later on Sunday. [O/R] \"It looks like we\u2019re headed for a massive ground invasion of Gaza and a large-scale loss of life,\" said Ben Cahill, senior fellow in the Energy Security and Climate Change Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). \"Anytime you have a conflict of this scale, you will have a market reaction.\" Market reaction in the past week has been relatively muted, though Israel's shekel currency took a big hit. \"I have no clue whether markets will remain relatively well behaved,\" said Erik Nielsen, group chief economics advisor at UniCredit. \"It almost certainly depends on whether this latest conflict remains localized or whether it escalates into a broader Middle Eastern war.\" The S&P 500 fell 0.5% on Friday. Safe-haven assets saw buying with gold up more than 3% on Friday and the U.S. dollar touching a one-week high. An expanding conflict would also likely cause inflation and, as a byproduct, interest rates around the world to accelerate further, said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at The Economic Outlook Group in Princeton, New Jersey. However, while inflation and rates in other countries will likely rise in this worst-case scenario, the United States could be the exception as foreign investors pour capital into what they deem a safe haven during global conflict, Baumohl noted. \"Interest rates could go down,\" he said. \"Expect the dollar to strengthen.\" In Europe, economists said the bar for another rate hike from the European Central Bank was high. The war between the Islamist group Hamas and Israel poses one of the most significant geopolitical risks to oil markets since Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year. \"If the Ukraine war taught us anything, it's not to underestimate the effect of geopolitics,\" Nomura European economist George Moran said on the bank's week ahead podcast. Other energy markets could be impacted, as seen in recent developments such as Chevron halting natural gas exports through a major subsea pipeline between Israel and Egypt. Rising oil prices are unlikely to have a significant impact on U.S. gas prices or consumer spending, analysts noted. The situation, however, bears monitoring, Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital, said. \"If all of a sudden either oil production is cut or oil transport is disrupted then that certainly creates problems not just for economies but for markets too,\" he said. Oil, shares of oil companies and commodities in general and gold in particular could serve as effective hedges for investors, Ablin said.

        "text": " QUITO, Ecuador (AP) \u2014 Frightened by unprecedented violence on the streets and within prisons, Ecuadorians have a universal demand for the president they are choosing Sunday \u2014 safety. The runoff election in the South American country pits an heir to a banana empire, Daniel Noboa, against an attorney, Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez. Both have limited governing experience and will undoubtedly have their work cut out. The election comes as more Ecuadorians become victims of drug-related violence that erupted roughly three years ago and intensified in August, when a presidential candidate was assassinated in broad daylight. People continuously watch their backs and limit how often they leave home. The uneasiness even pushed Noboa to add a bulletproof vest to his daily outfit. Whoever wins with a simple majority of votes will govern for only 15 months, until May 2025, which is what remains of the tenure of President Guillermo Lasso. He cut his term short when he dissolved the country's National Assembly in May as lawmakers carried out impeachment proceedings against him over alleged improprieties in a contract by a state-owned company. Lasso, a conservative former banker, clashed constantly with lawmakers after his election in 2021 and decided not to run in the special election. On Sunday, he called on Ecuadorians to have a peaceful election and think about what is \"best for their children, their parents and the country.\u201d He said voters have the wisdom \u201cto banish demagoguery and authoritarianism as they look toward a tomorrow of peace and well-being for all.\u201d He added that the government would ensure security, transparency and respect for the election results. Under Lasso's watch, violent deaths soared, reaching 4,600 in 2022, the country\u2019s highest in history and double the total in 2021. The National Police tallied 3,568 violent deaths in the first half of 2023. The spike in violence is tied to cocaine trafficking. Mexican, Colombian and Balkan cartels have set roots in Ecuador and operate with assistance from local criminal gangs. Voting is mandatory in Ecuador for people ages 18 through 64. Those who don\u2019t comply face a fine of about $45. Polls will close in the late afternoon, and results were expected Sunday evening. \u201cI don\u2019t expect much from this election,\" Julio Ricaurte, a 59-year-old engineer, said Sunday near one of the voting centers in northern Quito, the capital. \u201cFirst, because the president will have little time to do anything, and second because the (National) Assembly in our country is an organization that prevents anyone who comes to power from governing.\u201d Noboa and Gonz\u00e1lez, both of whom have served short stints as lawmakers, advanced to the runoff by finishing ahead of six other candidates in the election\u2019s first round on Aug. 22. The replacement of Fernando Villavicencio, who was killed Aug. 9, as he left a campaign rally in Quito, finished in third place. Noboa, 35, is an heir to a fortune built on Ecuador\u2019s main crop, bananas. His political career began in 2021, when he won a seat in the National Assembly and chaired its Economic Development Commission. He opened an event organizing company when he was 18 and then joined his father\u2019s Noboa Corp., where he held management positions in the shipping, logistics and commercial industries. A large group of military and police officers as well as private security guards protected Noboa when he voted in Ol\u00f3n, a community on the country's central Pacific coast. He wore a bulletproof vest. \u201cI believe that the trend is irreversible, and today, we begin to build a new Ecuador,\u201d he said, confidently alluding to a victory. Gonz\u00e1lez, 45, held various government jobs during the decade-long presidency of Rafael Correa, her mentor, and was a lawmaker until May. She was unknown to most voters until Correa\u2019s party picked her as its presidential candidate. At the start of the campaign, she said Correa would be her adviser, but she has recently tried to distance herself a bit in an effort to court voters who oppose the former president. \u201cWe have full faith, hope, that Ecuador is going to take a turn toward dignity, toward a homeland of rights,\u201d she said after voting in the small town of Canuto. She, too, wore a bulletproof vest. National Police Cmdr. Gen. C\u00e9sar Zapata on Sunday said authorities investigated two reports of explosive devices outside Quito and deemed them to be false. He also said that 174 people had been arrested for violating a ban on alcohol sales on Election Day. Rosa Amagua\u00f1a, a 62-year-old fruit and vegetable vendor, said Sunday that safety \u201cis the first thing that must be solved\u201d by the next president. \u201cI'm hopeful the country will change,\u201d Amagua\u00f1a said. \"Yes, it can. The next president must be able to do even something small.\u201d ___ Garcia Cano reported from Caracas, Venezuela."

        "text": " By Matt Tracy WASHINGTON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Economists and market strategists are anticipating further ripple effects globally from the Middle East conflict, watching to see if the situation draws in other countries with the potential to increasingly drive up oil prices and send capital flowing to safehavens. Israel was preparing on Saturday to launch a ground assault in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, after telling Palestinians living in the territory to flee south. The Israeli national security adviser, meanwhile, warned Lebanese militant group Hezbollah not to start a war on a second front. \"It looks like we\u2019re headed for a massive ground invasion of Gaza and a large-scale loss of life,\" said Ben Cahill, senior fellow in the Energy Security and Climate Change Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). \"Anytime you have a conflict of this scale, you will have a market reaction.\" In the past week, concerns about the conflict have fed through to asset prices, contributing to weakness in stocks on Friday with the S&P 500 down 0.5%. Safehaven assets saw buying with gold up more than 3% on Friday and the U.S. dollar touching a one-week high. Oil prices leapt nearly 6% on Friday as investors assessed what the conflict could mean for supplies from nearby countries in the world's top oil producing region. \"If it looks like a broadening conflict, oil prices will rise further,\" said Michael Englund, chief economist at Action Economics LLC in Boulder, Colorado. An expanding conflict would also likely cause inflation and, as a byproduct, interest rates around the world to accelerate, said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at The Economic Outlook Group in Princeton, New Jersey. However, while inflation and rates in other countries will likely rise in this worst-case scenario, the U.S. could be the exception as foreign investors pour capital into what they deem a safehaven during global conflict, Baumohl noted. \"Interest rates could go down,\" he said. \"Expect the dollar to strengthen.\" Other fuels could also be impacted, as seen in recent developments such as Chevron halting natural gas exports through a major subsea pipeline between Israel and Egypt. \"The bigger risk to the oil market is that this conflict draws in neighboring countries,\" said CSIS' Cahill. Rising oil prices are unlikely to have a significant impact on U.S. gas prices or consumer spending, analysts noted. \"The consumer is unlikely to see a significant impact on gas prices anytime soon,\" Englund said.

        "text": " By Kirsty Needham SYDNEY, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Australia's decision to deny constitutional recognition to its First Peoples could herald a more divisive \"Trump-style\" politics at the next national election, while pushing the prime minister to pivot to cost of living issues, some analysts said. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese misread the public mood, analysts said on Sunday, as he took responsibility for the referendum result, in which only the national capital voted \"Yes\" from among eight states and territories. More than 60% of Australians voted \"No\" to altering the constitution to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people through the creation of an Indigenous advisory body. While Albanese said he respected the decision and his government would seek \"a new way forward\", some analysts saw the conservative opposition buoyed by its success in opposing the landmark vote. For Albanese, the referendum loss would be \"a personal as well as a political blow \u2013 he's very committed to equity for First Nations peoples\", said Chris Wallace, a specialist in political history and leadership at the University of Canberra. Now he is expected to pivot to addressing cost of living issues pressing on voters, which had made it harder to win the referendum, she added. Australia had rejected the \"prime minister's referendum\", said opposition party leader Peter Dutton, adding that his conservative Liberal party would look to form policies to take to the next national election, due in 2025. Dutton had opposed the referendum to cement his political position, and showed himself to be \"an effective, even superior campaigner\", said Mark Kenny, a professor at the Australian National University. \"He's going after the blue-collar Labor base in the suburbs and regions, informed by the teachings of Trump and Farage,\" Kenny added. \"Australia may be in for a much more aggressive and divided style of politics seen in the U.S. and U.K.\" Albanese made an error of judgment in pursuing a referendum that lacked cross-parliamentary support, as Liberal coalition partner the Nationals opposed it a year ago, said Kenny, who is with the university's Australian Studies Institute. Elected in 1996, Albanese saw the failure of the 1999 referendum for Australia to become a republic. Despite that experience as a lawmaker \"he squandered it, misreading the mood spectacularly,\" Kenny said. No referendum has passed in Australia without bipartisan backing. Moderate voters abandoned the Liberal party at last year's election, switching to so-called Teal independent candidates in key inner city seats, and installing a Labor government for the first time in nine years. Analysis of Saturday's referendum result showed outer metropolitan suburbs in the most populous states of New South Wales and Victoria voted \"No\", while the inner city seats that switched from Liberal to independent last year voted \"Yes\". Dutton may not try to win back these Teal seats at the next election, Kenny said, adding that almost all of Labor's rural and outer-suburban, working class seats voted \"No\". On Sunday, Nationals lawmaker Bridget McKenzie criticised \"Yes\" voters as \"very privileged, highly educated Australians in wealthy suburbs\". Former Liberal Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who will join the board of Fox Corp next month, praised Dutton's \"courageous\" campaign against the referendum in an interview with Sky News. Abbott said what had been rejected was a change in the system of government, not the Aboriginal people. However, Simon Banks, managing director of government relations firm Hawker Britton and former chief of staff to three Labor leaders, said there would not be calls for Albanese to resign, and Dutton instead had \"the biggest political problem\". He added, \"Dutton has made the task for the Liberal Party to recover the so-called Teal seats significantly harder. Meanwhile national opinion polls show no significant adverse electoral impact for Labor.\" The latest Newspoll, published on Friday, shows Labor still two points up on the 2022 election result, and Albanese's popularity dipping only slightly, preferred by half of voters to be prime minister, compared to Dutton's 30%. The Liberal's \"wrecking ball campaign\" was easy to run, Wallace said, but \"to win the next election, it will have to replace Dutton with a more likeable leader\".

        "text": " By Byron Kaye and Praveen Menon SYDNEY, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Upbeat polls and big-name endorsements greeted Australia's referendum campaign for Indigenous reconciliation when it kicked off in earnest just seven months ago, raising hopes for a historic change to the constitution. But by the time votes were counted this weekend in the country's first referendum in nearly 25 years, the proposal for a permanent but non-voting \"Indigenous Voice\" in parliament had been dragged to a resounding defeat, dead by a thousand political cuts. The centre-left Labor government of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, acting on a campaign promise from last year's general election, crafted the plan along lines requested by elders of the Indigenous community, which makes up 3.8% of Australia's 26 million population. But without advance buy-in from the opposition party for what had been anticipated as a unifying proposal, the \"Voice\" became vulnerable to misinformation, race-based suspicion and political indifference, which opponents exploited to turn voters against it. \"Initially it was a proposition that seemed to a lot of Australians to be above politics,\" said Kos Samaras, a former strategist for the Labor party who now runs a political consultancy, Redbridge Group. \"Once the bipartisanship was gone and there was significant formal opposition to it ... that then bought it down into the political cesspit.\" As academics and analysts sort through the wreckage of the failed vote, they point to a variety of data on past referendums and recent social media trends that show both the under-appreciated obstacles the campaign faced, and how the ground has shifted for political battles in increasingly divided societies. Matt Qvortrup, a visiting professor of constitutional law at Australian National University who studies referendums, said such campaigns start with an average 55.9% of voters in favour but lose seven percentage points if they are not supported by both sides of parliament. \"Everybody has to know that politics is compromise,\" he said, adding that some voters will also typically peel off when they examine the proposal in more detail. The impact of partisan politics on the referendum played out in particularly dramatic form on social media. Among posts on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, those in favour of the \"Voice\" continuously outnumbered posts against it before the opposition Liberal Party leader Peter Dutton formalised his party's stance on April 5. Posts advocating a \"Yes\" vote jumped more than 500% the next day as \"Voice\" supporters criticised Dutton, but those advocating \"No\" gained momentum and five weeks later were outnumbering \"Yes\", according to a study of 250,000 posts on X by Timothy Graham, a Queensland University of Technology researcher who studies social media. With the \"No\" campaign's popularity building and only a single referendum question to shoot down, conspiracy theories and misinformation spread faster on social media and, ultimately, filtered into the mainstream conversation, Graham added. The public support and millions of dollars in contributions from Australia's biggest banks, miners, retailers and other corporations - Qantas decorated three of its aircraft with \"Yes23\" logos - along with endorsements from sports and entertainment celebrities including Cate Blanchett, Russell Crowe, Chris Hemsworth, Jason Mamoa and even former NBA star Shaquille O'Neal also proved to be a mixed blessing. \"['Yes'] used 'successful Australia' to try to communicate a message of separation, not inclusion, to 'unsuccessful Australia',\" said Samaras, the political consultant and former Labor Party strategist. He noted similarities with the 2016 votes for U.S. President Donald Trump and Britain's departure from the European Union. \"Using corporates and celebrities like that was just crazy,\" he said. What's more, the \"Yes\" camp's compelling narrative of human rights and rectifying historical injustices for Indigenous people often got pushed into the background when public discussion turned to rising living costs and inflation. Wealthier inner-city suburbs mostly backed the change but every outer suburban electoral seat opposed it, because \"currently people's No.1 concern is cost of living\", said Paul Smith, director of government for poll provider YouGov which had predicted defeat. \"The 'Voice' was not very high up on people's list,\" Smith said. But it was a repudiation from Australia's conservative coalition, the opposition, that proved decisive in the referendum's failure. An Australian referendum requires a majority vote in at least four of its six states, as well as nationally. Ultimately, no state supported the \"Voice\" and the national vote was 40% \"Yes\" to 60% \"No\", according to preliminary counting. Liberal leader Dutton, who at the time the referendum campaign launched was still consolidating his position as party leader and was reeling from a by-election loss, quickly staked out his party's opposition to the \"Voice\". He repeatedly questioned the lack of detail on the proposed advisory body, and said it would divide the country by race, introduce more bureaucracy, and not provide practical outcomes. After the votes were counted, Dutton said his party supported Indigenous reconciliation but he made no mention of an alternative measure. He instead repeated his call to investigate child abuse in the Indigenous community and to audit spending on Indigenous programmes, \"so that we can get the money where it's needed \u2013 to those families in regional and remote areas\". Analysts said Prime Minister Albanese also miscalculated by running with the Indigenous leaders' plan before consulting and, if necessary, compromising with the opposition. \"He thought the lead was unassailable,\" said Australia National University's Qvortrup. Albanese, asked on Saturday why the vote had failed, said no referendum had succeeded without bipartisan support. \"Changing the constitution is hard,\" he said. \"There are no guarantees of success.\" (Reporting by Byron Kaye and Praveen Menon; Editing by Edmund Klamann)"

        "text": " (Bloomberg) -- New Zealanders have chosen a center-right government to manage mounting economic challenges in the aftermath of the pandemic, rejecting the left-leaning administration of Prime Minister Chris Hipkins. Most Read from Bloomberg Israel Latest: Army Says Over 600,000 Gazans Have Fled South US Pushes Bid to Avert Wider Israel War After Iran Warning Israel Latest: Biden and Abbas Talk as Gaza Invasion Nears Your Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas War Global Markets Stable as US Pushes to Contain Middle East War Christopher Luxon will become the South Pacific nation\u2019s new premier after his National Party won the biggest share of the vote in Saturday\u2019s election. Hipkins conceded defeat, bringing the curtain down on six years of Labour Party rule. \u201cThe New Zealand people had a mood for change,\u201d Luxon told reporters on Sunday. \u201cWe are going to deliver a strong and stable government that\u2019s going to get things done.\u201d The election result lends weight to the global pattern of voters deserting the government in charge during Covid-19, a hurdle that ruling parties in the UK and Canada may face in elections over the next two years. Despite one of the lowest pandemic mortality rates in the world, New Zealanders resoundingly turned their backs on Labour, marking the end of a period defined by former prime minister Jacinda Ardern. \u201cThere\u2019s a global discontent at the moment towards all incumbents,\u201d said Bryce Edwards, a political analyst at Victoria University of Wellington. \u201cTo some extent Labour has just been unlucky to be in charge of things while the mood has soured. It does relate to Covid, it does relate to the general state of the economy.\u201d Luxon must now negotiate with his ally the libertarian ACT Party, and possibly the nationalist New Zealand First Party, to agree on a governing arrangement that commands a majority in parliament. Those talks could take several weeks and may see ACT and New Zealand First winning policy concessions and ministerial posts from National in return for their support. Read More: Dancing Libertarian Poised for Big Role in New Zealand Politics Preliminary results show National won 39% of the vote, while ACT had 9% and New Zealand First got 6.5%. Labour slumped to 27% from 50% three years ago, bleeding support to parties on the right and left. Its ally the Green Party grew its share of the vote to 10.8% from 7.9% in 2020 and took key electorates from Labour. Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori, which stands for the rights of the indigenous M\u0101ori people, doubled its number of seats in parliament to four. Winston Returns But the biggest winner among the smaller parties was New Zealand First, which returns to parliament after being ejected three years ago. For its leader, the 78-year-old maverick Winston Peters, it\u2019s another remarkable comeback in a 44-year political career. While National and ACT currently have a parliamentary majority between them, they may lose it when official results, which include special and overseas votes, are published on Nov. 3. That would see Peters holding the balance of power. Peters told reporters on Sunday that the country is in \u201can economic and social crisis\u201d and \u201csome of the promises you heard in this campaign won\u2019t be worth confetti.\u201d The new government faces a challenging economic outlook, with the central bank forecasting a recession as it keeps interest rates high to bring inflation under control. Government debt has increased as Labour borrowed more to battle the pandemic and pay for the recovery from a devastating cyclone earlier this year. National has promised tax cuts partially funded by removing a ban on the sale of expensive homes to foreigners and collecting a levy on each transaction. It also plans to strip the Reserve Bank of its dual mandate and return it to a sole focus on inflation. China Stance Luxon, the former chief executive of Air New Zealand who entered politics only three years ago, has spoken of the need for New Zealand to build its international relationships with countries such as India and China, already its largest trading partner. While Luxon is unlikely to distance New Zealand from traditional western partners like the UK, US and Australia, he may be more pro-China than the Labour administration, said Robert Patman, professor of politics at the University of Otago in Dunedin. Former National Party prime minister John Key \u201chas actually criticized the Labour government for some of its anti-Chinese rhetoric, and Luxon is something of a protege of John Key,\u201d Patman said. While the final shape of the new government remains uncertain, all three likely participants campaigned on cutting government spending, getting tougher on criminals and welfare beneficiaries, and halting moves to give indigenous M\u0101ori a bigger role in decision-making on local authorities. All three also favor farmer-friendly policies, and could be expected to delay plans to tax agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. The election result draws a line under Ardern\u2019s five years in office, during which she won global praise for her crisis management and empathetic style of leadership. She was rewarded with a landslide election victory three years ago, but since then the economic results of her pandemic response have turned voters against Labour. Ardern stood down in January in favor of Hipkins.

Israel has urged exhausted Gazans to evacuate south, which hundreds of thousands have already done in the besieged enclave that is home to more than 2 million people. Hamas, which runs Gaza, has told people to ignore Israel's message. Inside Gaza's narrow and crowded streets, conditions were deteriorating as deaths from Israeli air strikes rose. Bodies were stored in ice cream freezer trucks because moving them to hospitals was too risky and cemeteries were full. With fears of the conflict spilling further, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken continued his tour of Middle East states, seeking to prevent escalation and secure the release of 155 hostages Israel says were taken by Hamas back into Gaza. Arab leaders stressed the need to protect Gaza civilians. \"The reaction went beyond the right to self-defence, turning into collective punishment,\" said Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi of Israel's retaliatory strikes. Clashes on Israel's border with Lebanon, the deadliest since 2006, have underscored the dangers of regional spillover. On Sunday, Hamas' armed wing Al Qassam Brigades said it fired 20 rockets from Lebanon at two Israeli settlements while Lebanon's Hezbollah militia said it fired missiles at Israeli barracks in Hanita and had inflicted casualties. Israel said it was striking Lebanon in retaliation, and the U.N. peacekeeping force said its headquarters in south Lebanon had been hit by a rocket. Iran, which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah, warned Israel of escalation if it kept attacking Palestinians. \"If the Zionist aggressions do not stop, the hands of all parties in the region are on the trigger,\" said Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, adding that Tehran could not simply stay an observer. Blinken met Saudi Arabia's Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh then Sisi in Cairo. Amid international efforts to ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Blinken said the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt would reopen. \"There's a determination in every country I went to, to make sure that this conflict doesn't spread,\" said Blinken, who was due back in Israel on Monday. \"They are using their own influence, their own relationships, to try to make sure that this doesn't happen.\" ISRAELI RESOLVE Netanyahu convened Israel's expanded emergency cabinet, including former opposition lawmakers, in a show of unity. \"Hamas thought we would be demolished. It is we who will demolish Hamas,\" he said. Israel is carrying out the most intense bombardment Gaza has ever seen in response to the killing of 1,300 people when Hamas fighters rampaged through Israeli towns on Oct. 7. They shot men, women, children and soldiers and seized hostages in the worst attack on civilians in Israel's history. Graphic video of the attacks, and reports from medical and emergency services in the overrun towns and kibbutzes, deepened Israelis' sense of shock. France said 19 of its citizens had died in the Hamas attacks, with 13 others still unaccounted for and possibly taken hostage. Canada raised its fatality toll to five. Authorities in Gaza said at least 2,670 people had so far been killed by Israel's retaliatory strikes, a quarter of them children, and nearly 10,000 wounded. Another 1,000 people were missing and believed to be under rubble. Gaza hospitals are running short of supplies and struggling to cope with the numbers of wounded. Among them was 4-year-old Fulla Al-Laham, 14 members of whose family, including her parents and siblings, died in an Israeli air strike. \"May God keep me alive to take care of her,\" said her grandmother Um Muhammed Al-Laham, who held the girl's hand as she lay in a hospital on a drip with a bandaged arm. ON THE MOVE Israel's military, which has massed tanks on Gaza's border in preparation for a ground offensive, says it is targeting Hamas and its infrastructure. Israeli aircraft on Sunday struck about 250 military targets, killing the Hamas southern district commander, the military said. Israeli military chief Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi told soldiers near the Gaza border they would be entering Gaza to root out Hamas, targeting \"every place, every commander, every operator.\" \"You are about to do something big and important, that needs to change the situation for a long time in a clear way,\" Halevi said. An Israeli blockade has prevented fuel, food and water from entering Gaza, although Netanyahu had agreed with U.S. President Joe Biden to resume the water supply to parts of southern Gaza, a minister said on Sunday. The Israeli military said some 600,000 Gazans had left the northern half of the territory, which includes Gaza City's more than 1 million residents. Some Palestinians who went south said they were heading back north because they were attacked wherever they went. Hussam Abu Safiya, an intensive care doctor on a children's ward at the Kamal Edwan hospital in northern Gaza, said the order to evacuate was impossible. \"In this ward as you can see, there are children who are attached to ventilators, and now we have been asked to evacuate the hospital, where should we evacuate these children?\" The World Health Organization said Israel's orders to evacuate 22 Gaza hospitals were a \"death sentence for the sick and injured\". UN relief operations in Gaza \"are on the verge of collapse,\" said Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general of the UN agency for the Palestinians, UNRWA. \"The number of people seeking shelter in our schools and other UNRWA facilities in the south is absolutely overwhelming, and we do not have any more the capacity to deal with them,\" he said.

        "text": " By Justyna Pawlak WARSAW, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Poles vote on Sunday in a parliamentary election the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) hopes will earn it an unprecedented third term in office, while the opposition warns it could put the country on a path towards leaving the European Union. Opinion polls suggest PiS will come out ahead but could lose its majority amid intensifying discontent over its democratic record, which has cost Poland billions of euros in EU aid, and concerns over women's rights and the cost of living. With war raging in neighbouring Ukraine and a migrant crisis brewing, the EU and Washington are watching the vote closely, although both PiS and its mainstream opposition support NATO-member Poland's key role in providing military and logistical support to Kyiv. PiS has cast the election as a choice between security from unfettered migration, which it says its opponents support, and a creeping westernisation it sees as contrary to Poland's Catholic character. \"This election will show whether Poland will be governed by Poles, or by Berlin or Brussels,\" PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski told supporters at the party's last campaign rally on Friday. \"What will win is good, patriotic governance ... not the screaming and hatred that fill the media and which affect weaker minds,\" he said in Skarzysko Kamienna, a city in the PiS heartland in southeastern Poland. Since sweeping to power in 2015, the party has been accused of undermining democratic checks and balances, politicising the courts, using publicly owned media to push its own propaganda, and stirring up homophobia. PiS denies wrongdoing, or wanting to leave the EU, and says its reforms aim to make the country and its economy more fair while removing the last vestiges of communism. It has built its support on generous social handouts, which it says rival parties will stop. Its main rival, the liberal Civic Coalition (KO), led by former European Council president Donald Tusk, has campaigned on a pledge to undo PiS reforms, hold its leaders to account and resolve conflicts with Brussels over democratic rule. Tusk says his party would maintain social support. \"We need change if you care about fundamental values such as trust, accountability, tolerance to dominate public life again,\" Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, who is a senior KO official, told voters on Friday in Kalisz, in central Poland. Voting starts at 7 a.m. local time (0500 GMT) and ends at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT) Political analysts say Poland could face a period of instability if PiS fails to secure a majority. One option would be to rely on lawmakers from the far-right Confederation party, whose support among younger voters jumped earlier this year on the back of promises to reduce taxes and limit support for Ukrainian refugees. The mainstream opposition might also end up with a majority, but it may take time before it has a turn at forming a government if PiS takes the top spot. Regardless of who wins, credit rating agencies believe that pledges of higher social spending will be hard to reverse, raising questions about the public finances and leaving markets jittery. Foreign investors have pulled $2.3 billion from domestic government bonds and in July held less than 15% of outstanding bonds, the lowest level in well over a decade and below the historic average of 20%, JPMorgan calculations show.

The statement from the Israeli military didn\u2019t specify a time frame.

Ahead of the invasion, protests took place around the world, with tens of thousands of people believed to have attended the biggest rally in London. (All timestamps are Israeli time) US Deploys Second Aircraft Carrier Group (2:17 a.m.) The US is sending a second aircraft carrier group to the eastern Mediterranean in support of Israel, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement. The USS Eisenhower carrier strike group will join the USS Gerald Ford, sent shortly after the Hamas attacks from Gaza last week. Austin said the deployments \u201csignal the United States\u2019 ironclad commitment to Israel\u2019s security and our resolve to deter any state or non-state actor seeking to escalate this war.\u201d US Says 29 Citizens Dead, 15 Missing Since Hamas Attacks (12:04 a.m.) At least 29 Americans are confirmed to have died in the violence in Israel since the Hamas attacks, while the US is aware of 15 citizens and one lawful permanent resident who are unaccounted for, the State Department said in a statement late Saturday. The US is sharing intelligence with Israel and deploying US government experts \u201cto advise the Israeli government on hostage recovery efforts,\u201d the statement said. Biden Speaks With Abbas, Netanyahu On Civilian Aid (11:49 p.m.) US President Joe Biden spoke with Palestinian Authority President Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday to discuss efforts to ensure civilians in Gaza had access to food, water and medical care. In the call with Abbas, the first known talk between the two since last week\u2019s attacks, Biden condemned Hamas and offered the Palestinian Authority his \u201cfull support\u201d on efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to Palestinians, the White House said in a statement. Biden spoke with both leaders about joint efforts to work with the United Nations, Egypt and Jordan to help secure the delivery of supplies to civilians in Gaza. Biden also provided an update on US military support for Israel in his call with Netanyahu, the fifth since last weekend\u2019s attacks. Liberman to Join Emergency Government (8:33 p.m.) Israel\u2019s Likud Party announced that Avigdor Liberman, who heads the opposition party Yisrael Beitenu, agreed to join the emergency war government as a cabinet member. His party has six seats in parliament. Earlier this week, Benny Gantz, leader of a bigger opposition party, helped form the emergency government by joining with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Blinken Urges China to Use Its Influence in Israel Conflict (8:25 p.m.) US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Beijing to use its influence to prevent other state or non-state actors from attacking Israel and widening its war with Hamas, the State Department said. Blinken spoke with Foreign Minister Wang Yi before departing from Riyadh, where the top US diplomat was attempting to shore up support for Israel among Arab nations, said State Department spokesman Matthew Miller. Israel Acknowledges Reports of Gaza Activity Before Attacks (8:18 p.m.) Israel confirmed for the first time that there were intelligence indications of something happening in Gaza two hours before the attacks last week. The head of Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s internal security service, spoke with military personnel about the reports, said Tzachi Hanegbi, head of Israel\u2019s National Security Council. \u201cBoth sides assessed that this is something other than it turned out to be,\u201d he said. Israeli Army Preparing Land-Sea-Air Attack on Gaza (7:36 pm) The Israel Defense Forces said it\u2019s preparing to \u201cto implement a wide range of offensive operative plans which include, among other things, an integrated and coordinated attack from the air, sea and land,\u201d according to a military statement. It didn\u2019t give any indication of timing. Soldiers are deployed all over the country and are prepared for the next stage of the war \u201cwith an emphasis on a significant ground operation.\u201d The army will be backed by hundreds of thousands of service members after it completed a mobilization of reservists. Thousands March in London in Pro-Palestinian Rally (7:17 p.m.) Thousands of people took to the streets across the UK in a series of pro-Palestinian demonstrations, with tens of thousands believed to have attended the biggest rally in London. More than 1,000 police were deployed in London and the rallies remained peaceful, even after authorities threatened to arrest anyone demonstrating in support of Hamas. Macron Calls on Netanyahu to Spare Civilians (7:03 p.m.) French President Emmanuel Macron urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a phone call to abide by humanitarian law and spare civilians, an Elysee official said. France has also warned Lebanese group Hezbollah to stay away from the war, the official added. Turkey Opposes Forced Migration of Palestinians Toward Gaza (5:06 p.m.) Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan says Turkey is standing with Cairo in opposing Israel\u2019s policy of \u201cdriving Palestinians toward Egypt.\u201d Turkish military cargo planes, carrying food and medical supplies for the Gaza Strip, arrived in Egypt, Fidan said at a briefing with his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry in Cairo. Border Crossing to Egypt From Gaza Remains Closed (5 p.m.) Egypt is refusing to allow foreign nationals in Gaza to cross the Rafah border point, the local media outlet Al Qahera News reported. Cairo\u2019s position that the crossing should be used to provide aid is clear, the TV channel said on X, formerly Twitter, citing what it called informed sources in Egypt. Foreigners living in or visiting Gaza weren\u2019t being allowed out by Israel on Saturday due to an unspecified operational concern related to security, according to a person familiar with the situation. Israel, Hezbollah Exchange Fire (2:45 p.m.) Hezbollah struck Israeli army posts with guided missiles and artillery fire, the militant group\u2019s Al Manar television reports. Live footage shows artillery fire striking the post near Shebaa Farms, a politically disputed border area. Israel is responding to the fire, the Israeli defense forces said, striking sites in southern Lebanon. Hamas Says Nine More Hostages Die in Strikes (2:30 p.m.) Hamas\u2019s military wing said Israeli air strikes in Gaza killed another nine hostages in the past 24 hours, including four foreigners. This takes the number of captives who\u2019ve died from Israeli bombing to 26, according to Hamas. The Palestinian militant group abducted about 120 people, mostly civilians, and took them back to Gaza during the mass incursion into southern Israel a week ago. Blinken Underlines Need to Look Out for Civilians (1 p.m.) The US and Saudi Arabia need to ensure that the conflict doesn\u2019t spread to other fronts, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in Riyadh after meeting with his Saudi counterpart Faisal bin Farhan. Americans Might Be Allowed to Leave Gaza (12:30 p.m.) American citizens in the Gaza Strip may be allowed to leave on Saturday, according to a US official with knowledge of the situation. Americans May Leave Gaza on Saturday, Says US Official Still, while Israel and Egypt have said they can exit via the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, it\u2019s unclear if Hamas will agree to that, said the official, who declined to be identified discussing private talks. Water Running Out in Gaza, Says UNRWA (12:05 p.m.) Across the Gaza Strip, more than 2 million people are at risk as water runs out, said the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which serves Palestinian refugees. People are now forced to use dirty water from wells, increasing risks of waterborne diseases, it said. \u201cWe need to truck fuel into Gaza now,\u201d said Juliette Touma, a UNRWA spokesperson. \u201cFuel is the only way for people to have safe drinking water. If not, people will start dying of severe dehydration, among them young children, the elderly and women.\u201d Israel Says It Kills Senior Hamas Commander (8:15 a.m.) Israel said it killed Hamas\u2019s head of aerial systems for Gaza City, Merad Abu Merad, in an airstrike. He was, Israel says, in large part responsible for directing last Saturday\u2019s attacks. The Israel Defense Forces said he was killed when jets struck operational headquarters used by Hamas. The group hasn\u2019t confirmed his death. Overnight, Israeli fighter jets conducted wide-scale strikes throughout the Gaza Strip, the IDF said. Israel at War Transmits Market Risk Across Skittish Middle East China, EU Discuss Middle East Tensions (5:30 a.m.) The Middle East was one of the most important topics in the latest talks between the European Union and China, top EU diplomat Josep Borrell said Saturday at the end of his trip to the Asian nation. Talk of War Dominates Annual Gathering of Global Finance Chiefs Both sides agreed the only long-term solution to the Palestinian issue is a two-state plan, Borrell said. While Israel has a right to defend itself, \u201clike any right, it has a limit,\u201d which in this case is international humanitarian law, he said. It is \u201cutterly, utterly impossible to implement\u201d an evacuation of Gaza, he added. Israel Hits Hezbollah Sites in Lebanon (3:50 a.m.) Israel said strikes had been carried out on Hezbollah posts in southern Lebanon in response to \u201cunidentified\u201d objects that had entered northern Israeli airspace hours earlier. Israeli Poll Shows Netanyahu\u2019s Popularity Drops as Gantz Surges The objects were shot down by unmanned Israeli aircraft, the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement on Friday night. Hezbollah, a militia and political party that is backed by Iran, said earlier that it was prepared to act against Israel over its war in Gaza. The US designates Hezbollah as a terrorist organization.

        "text": " (Adds details on draft resolution paragraphs 3-4, Israel-Hamas conflict) WASHINGTON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Russia has asked the United Nations Security Council to vote Monday on a draft resolution on the Israel-Hamas conflict that calls for a humanitarian ceasefire and condemns violence against civilians and all acts of terrorism. Russia's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy said on Saturday no changes had been made to the text since it was given to the 15-member body on Friday and that he expected the vote to be scheduled for 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT) on Monday. The one-page draft resolution also calls for the release of hostages, humanitarian aid access and the safe evacuation of civilians in need. It refers to Israel and the Palestinians but does not directly name Hamas. A U.N. Security Council resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, Britain, France, China or Russia. The United States has traditionally shielded its ally Israel from any Security Council action. Israel was preparing on Saturday to launch a ground assault against Iran-backed Hamas in the Gaza Strip, after telling Palestinians living in the densely populated territory to move south towards a closed border with Egypt. Israel has vowed to annihilate Hamas in retaliation for an attack by the Palestinian Islamist group a week ago. Hamas stormed Israeli towns, killing 1,300 people and seizing scores of hostages - the worst attack on civilians in Israel's history. Israeli jets and artillery have already subjected Gaza to the most intense bombardment it has ever seen, putting the enclave, home to 2.3 million Palestinians, under total siege. Gaza authorities say more than 2,200 people have been killed. (Reporting by Michelle Nichols; Editing by Doina Chiacu and Chizu Nomiyama)"

Lebanon's Iran-backed, heavily armed Hezbollah group has clashed with Israel across the Lebanese border multiple times in the past week in the deadliest confrontations since they fought a month-long war in 2006. U.N. Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland met with Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian in Beirut on Saturday, the United Nations said. Abdollahian then met with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Qatar, Al Jazeera TV reported. When asked about the Axios report, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said: \"All of (Wennesland's) meetings have been to discuss diplomatic efforts to release hostages, secure humanitarian access and prevent a spillover of the conflict to the wider region.

It was the fifth straight day of assaults on the town in Ukraine's industrial heartland of Donbas, focal point of Moscow's 19-month-old invasion of its neighbour. Both Russia and the United States have described the upsurge in violence around Avdiivka as a new Russian offensive. Fighting intensified in other sectors of the 1,000-km-long (600-mile) front. One top Ukrainian commander said clashes further north had \"significantly worsened\", while another said Russian losses were mounting in the war's southern sectors. Vitaliy Barabash, head of Avdiivka's military administration, said residents had experienced a rare overnight respite from air strikes, but attacks had resumed at daybreak. \"They are striking with everything they have. Bouts of shooting, artillery, multiple rocket launchers, mortars and a lot of aircraft,\" Barabash told national television. All rescue operations had been halted, he said, amid reports of people believed to be trapped under rubble of buildings levelled by shelling and air strikes. \"Operations cannot take place in such conditions. It is frightening to leave because the road is under fire. And no easier to stay as there is no place, no basement that can withstand the strikes.\" Barabash said 1,620 residents remained in Avdiivka, a town with a large coking plant and a pre-war population of 32,000. Oleksandr Stupun, a military spokesperson, said Avdiivka was important for Moscow \"because it is the only chance to show some kind of victory. They have no other options.\" Russian forces in the area, he told national television, \"have been increasing for four days in a row. That's why the enemy is taking revenge on the civilian population.\" The town, 20 km (12 miles) west of the Russian-held town of Donetsk, has become a watchword for resistance. It held off attacks in 2014 when Russian-backed separatists seized areas of eastern Ukraine and has undergone serious fortification since. A four-month-old Ukrainian counteroffensive has made some progress in both the east, near the shattered city of Bakhmut, taken by Russian troops in May, and in the south, where Kyiv hopes to reach the Sea of Azov. But gains have been incremental. Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukraine's ground forces, visited troops near Kupiansk further north and said Russian forces had regrouped after suffering losses. \"The main objective of the enemy is the defeat of a grouping of our troops, the encirclement of Kupiansk and to reach the Oskil River,\" a military platform quoted him as saying. A four-month-old Ukrainian counteroffensive has made some progress in the east, near Bakhmut, and in the south, where Kyiv hopes to reach the Sea of Azov, but gains have been incremental. General Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, head of forces in the south, wrote on Telegram that Ukrainian troops were advancing southward and Russian casualties were \"continuing to rise\".

In his first call with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas since Hamas' attack on Israel a week ago, Biden offered Abbas his full support for \"urgently needed humanitarian assistance to Palestinian people, especially in Gaza.\" \"President Biden detailed U.S. efforts to coordinate with partners to prevent the conflict from widening, and the two leaders discussed the need to preserve stability in the West Bank and the broader region,\" the White House said in a statement.

Biden also updated the Israeli leader on U.S. military support and repeated his warning against any effort to broaden the conflict, it said. Biden also discussed U.S. coordination with the UN and regional countries on humanitarian aid for civilians. \"President Biden reaffirmed his support for all efforts to protect civilians,\" the White House said. The calls came as Israel was preparing on Saturday to launch a ground assault in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, after telling Palestinians living in the densely populated territory to flee south. Netanyahu told Biden that \"unity and determination\" were needed to achieve Israel's combat goals against Gaza's Hamas rulers, Netanyahu's office said, adding that he thanked the president for his support. Abbas' office said the Palestinian leader told Biden he completely rejects the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, as Israel retaliates for a deadly Hamas attack on its territory.

Yields plummeted as those comments, combined with haven demand stoked by Middle East conflict, painted a more supportive backdrop for US bonds. It was a sharp about-face. The rise in yields in recent weeks had seemed unstoppable, predicated on the Fed\u2019s policy rate remaining elevated indefinitely. But despite the week\u2019s rally, many investors are sticking with their expectations for higher-for-longer rates and see recent gains as fragile. Emboldened by poor Treasury auction demand, they\u2019re looking for long-term yields to rise further, and eventually moving back to above short-term ones, where historically they\u2019ve belonged. \u201cIt\u2019s being in restrictive territory that matters,\u201d Greg Peters, co-chief investment officer of PGIM Fixed Income, told Bloomberg Television Thursday. \u201cThe curve will continue to normalize. You\u2019ll definitely see back-end rates moving higher, maybe there\u2019s a little scope over the next 12 months for the front-end to move lower, but not a lot. I just think we have to move into this more normal environment.\u201d The fragility of the Treasury market\u2019s advance was in full view Thursday when gains were swept away by data showing that US inflation remains elevated, and from anemic demand for an auction of 30-year bonds, despite offering the highest yield since 2007. The odds of one more quarter-point hike later this year or by January rebounded, while the scope of rate cuts for 2024 eroded. Also, while a 12th Fed interest-rate increase is still considered less likely than a coin flip, several policy makers this week said they\u2019re open to raising rates further if necessary. What Bloomberg\u2019s Strategists Say... \u201cThe lion\u2019s share of the recent spike in long-term yields is explained by changes in market participants\u2019 perception of the Fed\u2019s monetary policy stance. Risk sentiment and fears of inflationary supply disruptions also play a role.\u201d \u201cOctober\u2019s mid-month auctions will provide another glimpse into investor\u2019s appetite for additional duration risk as Treasury supply narratives continue to weigh on markets.\u201d \u2014 Ana Galvao, senior economist, Bloomberg Intelligence Click here for the full report Haven demand bolstered the market Friday, with escalating Middle-East warfare stoking global recession fears. US economic fundamentals remain challenging for now, though, and Treasury supply is an ongoing source of angst. Consumer price growth failed to moderate as much as economists estimated in September, Thursday\u2019s data showed, while the separate inflation rate the Fed is trying to bring back to 2% quickened to 3.5% back in August. Even at a recent peak of 4.88%, the 10-year yield \u201cwas still very much priced for a 2% inflation world,\u201d Oksana Aronov, head of market strategy for alternative fixed income at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said on Bloomberg Television Thursday. \u201cSo I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the 10-year does cross 5%.\u201d As for supply, Treasury debt auctions were increased in size for the August-to-October quarter for the first time in more than two years, and another round of increases is anticipated for November-to-January, to be announced on Nov. 1. Expanded borrowing at a time of low unemployment \u201cis a very worrying position and is really unusual at this stage of the cycle,\u201d said Gene Tannuzzo, global head of fixed income at ColumbiaThreadneedle. He also is concerned about the potential for oil prices to keep upward pressure on inflation and long-term yields.

        "text": " (Bloomberg) -- The Qatari group led by Sheikh Jassim Bin Hamad J.J. Al Thani has withdrawn its bid to buy Manchester United, people familiar said, paving the way for British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe to eventually gain control of the storied football club. Most Read from Bloomberg Israel Latest: Army Says Over 600,000 Gazans Have Fled South US Pushes Bid to Avert Wider Israel War After Iran Warning Israel Latest: Biden and Abbas Talk as Gaza Invasion Nears Your Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas War Global Markets Stable as US Pushes to Contain Middle East War The Qataris had offered more than \u00a35 billion ($6,1 billion) for the team, compared to its current market value of $3.3 billion. The offer wasn\u2019t enough to satisfy the demands of the club\u2019s owners, the Glazer family, people familiar with their thinking said, who asked not to be named discussing private information. The near-yearlong bidding process has been beset with delays, with offers failing to meet the \u00a36 billion expectation of the Glazer family, splits among the owners about whether to sell and at what price, and fears of litigation from minority shareholders. Bloomberg reported this week that Ratcliffe had emerged as the front-runner to buy into Manchester United, with the British billionaire\u2019s recently revised offer giving him the edge over the Qataris. Under terms being discussed, Ratcliffe could make an offer for some of the shares held by both the Glazers and minority investors in Manchester United, the people said. Ratcliffe may end up with an initial stake of roughly 25% in Manchester United in a deal that could value the club at more than \u00a35 billion ($6.1 billion), they said. Ratcliffe would then slowly increase his ownership of the club at steadily higher valuations, one person said. Any offer from Ratcliffe could still risk opposition from minority shareholders. \u201cI will oppose anything that gives the majority Glazers a materially better deal than minority investors,\u201d said Ricky Sandler, founder of hedge fund Eminence Capital. \u201cThat is for sure.\u201d Eminence, founded by Sandler in 1999, manages about $7 billion of investments, and is the third largest shareholder of Manchester United\u2019s listed shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Manchester United board is set to meet in the coming days. However, discussions are still ongoing, and the Glazers could decide to keep the club, strike a deal with Ratcliffe or institutional investors, or a combination of the above. Any agreement would bring an end to the long-running battle for one of sport\u2019s biggest prizes. Manchester United competes in the English Premier League and its rich history and sprawling global fan base mean it\u2019s long been coveted by investors looking for a foothold in the world\u2019s richest football league. Ratcliffe\u2019s proposal could give certain members of the Glazer family, including Joel and Avram Glazer, a chance to remain invested \u2014 at least in the short term. That would likely infuriate some supporters of Manchester United, who have blamed its US owners for presiding over years of under-performance on the pitch and want them out of the club. Coming soon: Sign up for Bloomberg\u2019s Business of Sports newsletter for the context you need on the collision of power, money and sports, from the latest deals to the newest stakeholders. Delivered weekly. \u201cWe have always been neutral between Jassim and Ratcliffe,\u201d said Chris Rumfitt, head of Manchester United Supporters Trust. \u201cBut if the Ratcliffe deal maintained the Glazers\u2019 ultimately in charge I think that is something fans would be very hostile to.\u201d The decision from the Qatar camp comes about 10 months after an interview by Bloomberg with Sheik Jassim\u2019s father, former Qatar prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani. Sheikh Hamad, 64, said he isn\u2019t a fan of football and wasn\u2019t initially in favor of his country sponsoring the World Cup. The sale of Manchester United is being handled by bankers at US-based advisory firm Raine Group LLC. Representatives for Raine could not be immediately reached for comment. Spokespeople for Ratcliffe and Manchester United declined to comment. Ratcliffe put forward an initial proposal earlier this year to acquire 69% of shares in Manchester United owned by the Glazers. That left little benefit for holders of the club\u2019s remaining stock. A top-three shareholder in Manchester United previously sent a letter to the club\u2019s board warning that independent directors could be at risk of being sued for recommending any bid that favors one set of shareholders over another. Manchester United is one of England\u2019s most successful football clubs, boasting a record 13 Premier League titles. But its dominance of English football has shifted in recent years to crosstown rival Manchester City FC, which has won multiple honors since being taken over by Abu Dhabi investors in 2008. --With assistance from Susanne Barton.

        "text": " (Bloomberg) -- Risky private credit lending is vulnerable to higher interest rates and debt crunches, according to watchdogs across the globe that are seeking more transparency from the industry. Most Read from Bloomberg Israel Latest: Army Says Over 600,000 Gazans Have Fled South US Pushes Bid to Avert Wider Israel War After Iran Warning Israel Latest: Biden and Abbas Talk as Gaza Invasion Nears Your Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas War Global Markets Stable as US Pushes to Contain Middle East War The International Monetary Fund weighed in on the risks to financial stability from the fast-growing $1.5 trillion asset class, saying transparency needs to improve and that more data needs to be collected, including on cross-border exposures. Private credit is a \u201cprominent\u201d example of a market \u201csusceptible to substantial corrections because of the lagged effects of higher interest rates,\u201d the IMF said in a report on Tuesday. \u201cVulnerabilities\u201d in that market, among others, could \u201cpose risks to banks\u201d as well as other lenders. The warnings come after Moody\u2019s Investors Service said last month that competition among banks and direct lenders for deals in the leveraged buyout space will likely result in more defaults. Any race to the bottom on terms and pricing could have wider systemic risk implications, the ratings company said. Parts of the US private credit market have used greater leverage to boost returns, meaning the threat there could be more substantial, the Bank of England warned in July. \u201cThe industry has been growing quickly and it\u2019s attracting attention because it\u2019s now an important part of the economy,\u201d said Stuart Brinkworth, a partner at legal firm Mayer Brown. \u201cBut regulators struggle to understand the asset class and because of that the inclination is to assume that more regulation must be the answer.\u201d Private credit, dominated by the likes of Blackstone Group and Ares Management Corp., boomed as heavier regulation saw banks retrench after the financial crisis, opening up an opportunity for direct lenders. They\u2019ve been particularly active in leveraged buyout loans, taking advantage of the massive growth in mergers and acquisitions by private equity firms over the past decade. The asset class is safer than its reputation for opacity suggests, executives at the lenders say, because money managers who invest in the funds know the risks and their exposure to the asset class is usually a small fraction of their wider portfolio. Investors in the funds are typically tied up for years, meaning they can\u2019t just withdraw their money on short notice. Still, some watchdogs are proactively introducing new measures to limit the possibility of contagion during periods of market turmoil. The BOE, for example, plans to develop a permanent backstop facility for non-banks, including investment vehicles, which typically encompasses private credit. The facility would be available in times of stress to alleviate any risks to financial stability. Earlier this year, the European Union reached an agreement on new rules for private debt funds and other alternative asset managers that will require them to enhance liquidity management. That will aid any fund managers dealing with large outflows during times of financial turbulence, according to the July statement. \u201cWe believe the EU will be the outlier,\u201d said Ji\u0159\u00ed Kr\u00f3l, deputy chief executive officer at the Alternative Investment Management Association. \u201cMost global jurisdictions will steer clear of imposing prescriptive rules of this kind on private credit funds.\u201d If more regulations are introduced, then the biggest impact is likely to come in the form of costs and lower returns rather than changes to deal sizes or structures, insiders say. \u201cMore regulation and more administrative burden is going to cost money and it\u2019s likely that investors will primarily be the ones to bear that cost,\u201d said Art Penn, the founder of PennantPark Investment Advisers, which oversees about $6.6 billion. Week in Review Private credit lenders are in talks to provide around $2 billion of debt financing to support a potential buyout of CCC Intelligent Solutions Holdings Inc., a car-insurance software provider. Two of the world\u2019s biggest private credit firms have launched funds that will take far less profit than is usual for the industry \u2014 another sign of how power has started shifting toward investors in this $1.5 trillion market. Private credit managers are quietly providing record loans to existing borrowers seeking small acquisitions, stealthily building the value of their lending portfolios while adding more concentrated risks. Antares Capital is weighing an acquisition of European rival Hayfin Capital Management, a combination that would create a new private credit behemoth. HSBC is considering whether to enter Europe\u2019s $300 billion collateralized loan obligation market as an arranger. Private lenders are seeing an uptick in demand for niche capital relief trades, according to Magnetar Capital\u2019s David Snyderman. A handful of European companies have stepped away from their plans to sell junk debt recently, underscoring the difficulty of trying to navigate turbulent markets. Europe\u2019s booming leveraged loan market just had a reality check with the first halted transaction since a global banking crisis upended markets back in March. A lender-appointed receiver has taken steps to assume control of a Byju\u2019s unit in Singapore following months of failed negotiations with what was once one of India\u2019s hottest tech startups. Indian conglomerate Hinduja Group is in talks with private credit funds to raise about $800 million to back the acquisition of Reliance Capital. Private credit investments in India could double in the next two years, the head of BPEA Credit Group forecasts. Hillhouse, the investment firm started with backing from Yale University\u2019s endowment, is preparing to pitch a new Asia-focused private credit fund to international investors. On the Move Khalid Krim, head of Credit Suisse\u2019s EMEA debt capital markets desk, is leaving the bank after five years. Monarch Alternative Capital has hired Karan Malhotra as its head of structured credit trading. David Bourne, a managing director on the investment grade syndication and origination debt capital markets desk at TD Securities, is leaving the bank. HSBC Holdings Plc is assembling a team of bankers to connect its corporate clients with the rapidly expanding world of private credit. Bank of Nova Scotia recently hired three bankers from HSBC Holdings Plc in Canada to beef up its fixed-income syndication and trading desks. James Keller is joining Goldman Sachs in early December in its structured finance division. BNP Paribas SA hired two bankers who previously worked at Credit Suisse to join its credit desks. --With assistance from Dan Wilchins.

        "text": " MIAMI (AP) \u2014 A Florida executive whose family business once owned Playgirl magazine has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud for misleading investors in another of his companies \u2014 one that made high-interest loans to small businesses. Carl R. Ruderman, 82, was chairman and chief executive officer of 1 Global Capital LLC, a commercial lending company that filed for bankruptcy in July 2018. Federal authorities said he took part in a $250 million scheme that affected more than 3,400 investors in 42 states. Ruderman pleaded guilty Thursday in federal court in Miami. Court records show sentencing is set for Jan. 3, and he faces up to five years in prison and forfeiture of more than $250 million. Ruderman admitted spending 1 Global investors' money on credit card payments, vacation travel, drivers, nannies, housekeepers, tuition, mortgage payments, luxury car payments and insurance payments for his art collection and jewelry, the Justice Department said in a news release Friday Ruderman also admitted diverting investors' money to businesses benefitting him and his family, without investors\u2019 knowledge, the department said. The company \u2014 based in Hallandale Beach, Florida \u2014 made loans to small businesses, called merchant cash advance loans. Prosecutors compared those to payday loans. The Justice Department said Ruderman admitted he and others made false representations to investors and potential investors about the profitability of 1 Global. Investors were falsely told the company had been audited by a public accounting firm, that investors' money would be spent on the merchant cash advance loans, and that people could expect double-digit returns on investments. The Securities and Exchange Commission said in a 2018 complaint against Ruderman and 1 Global that the company collected money from investors, many of whom used retirement savings, from February 2014 to July 2018. The SEC said 1 Global was formed in 2013 and owned by the Ruderman Family Trust. The SEC said the trust also owned other businesses, including Digi South, which \u201cused to own Playgirl and other adult magazines.\u201d Digi South used the same address as 1 Global and \u201creceived approximately $805,000 in investor funds from 1 Global for no consideration or legitimate services,\u201d the SEC said. Four of Ruderman\u2019s co-conspirators previously pleaded guilty for their roles in the 1 Global fraud, the Justice Department said. Alan G. Heide, 65, of Lake Worth, Florida, the former 1 Global chief financial officer, pleaded guilty in 2019 to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. He was sentenced to five years in prison and ordered to pay more than $57 million in restitution. Andrew Dale Ledbetter, 81, a lawyer from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, pleaded guilty in 2021 to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud. He was sentenced to five years in prison and ordered to pay more than $148 million in restitution. Steven Allen Schwartz, 78, of Delray Beach, Florida, a director and consultant at 1 Global, pleaded guilty in 2020 to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud. He was sentenced to two years in prison and ordered to pay more than $36 million in restitution. Jan Douglas Atlas, 78, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, a lawyer, pleaded guilty in 2019 to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud. He was sentenced to eight months in prison and ordered to pay more than $29 million in restitution."

        "text": " SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a new law Friday to make low-income Mexican residents living near the border eligible for in-state tuition rates at certain community colleges. The legislation applies to low-income Mexicans who live within 45 miles (72 kilometers) of the California-Mexico border and want to attend a participating community college in Southern California. It is a pilot program that will launch next year and run until 2029. Some people travel frequently between Mexico and California to work or visit family. The law will help make education more accessible for those residents and prepare them for jobs, Assemblymember David Alvarez, who authored the proposal, said at a Senate Education Committee hearing in June. \u201cThis pilot program can unlock a significant untapped resource to prepare a more diverse population among our workforce,\" Alvarez said in a statement. Mark Sanchez, president of Southwestern College in Chula Vista, a California city about 7 miles (11 kilometers) from the border, said many students at the school split their time between the two countries. \u201cWithout this pilot, we risk everything in terms of loss of talent,\u201d he said at the hearing. The new law will require community college boards to submit a report to lawmakers by 2028 to show the attendance rate and demographics of students who received in-state tuition rates under the program. A similar law passed in 2015 allows some Nevada residents living near the California border to attend Lake Tahoe Community College at in-state tuition rates. ___ Sophie Austin is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

        "text": " (Corrects word 'Sheikh' in headline) By Anirban Sen and Mrinmay Dey Oct 14 (Reuters) - Qatar's Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al Thani has informed the Glazer family that controls Manchester United Plc that he will not improve on his bid to acquire the iconic soccer club for more than $6 billion, people familiar with the matter said. The move leaves the remaining bidder for Manchester United, Ineos Chair Jim Ratcliffe, in a stronger position. He has offered to buy only a 25% stake in the club, allowing some of the Glazers to cash out, and it remains unclear whether he will clinch an agreement. The exact value that Ratcliffe's bid infers on Manchester United could not be learned, but the sources said it was higher than Jassim's offer of more than $6 billion. Manchester United is currently valued by the stock market at $3.3 billion. Ratcliffe's deal, if finalised, could be announced later this month, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. Ratcliffe would oversee the team's operations and talent acquisition, while the Glazers will remain in charge of the commercial side of the business, according to the WSJ report. Jassim, who had also promised to invest more than $1.7 billion in Manchester United after he acquired it, still wants a deal but has informed the Glazer family that there is no point in remaining in the bidding process following nine months of unsuccessful negotiations, the sources said. Jassim would not have used any debt to acquire Manchester United and his bid would have paid down the club's existing debt pile, which net of cash totals more than $600 million, the sources added. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Representatives for Jassim declined to comment while Manchester United and Ratcliffe representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Sky News reported earlier on Saturday that Jassim was withdrawing from the bidding process. The Glazers' valuation expectations have been aggressive based on other soccer deals. Last year, the $3.1 billion acquisition of Chelsea Football Club by an investment group led by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital valued it at 5.7 times revenue for its last financial year. Valuing Manchester United more than Jassim's bid, at $7 billion for example, would be equivalent to 11 times the club's revenue over the last 12 months, according to LSEG data. The Glazer family, which made its fortune in real estate, retail and healthcare and also owns the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, bought the team for 790 million pounds ($960 million) in 2005. The six descendants of Malcolm Glazer, who died in 2014, together control 96% of Manchester United's voting stock. The club announced in November 2022 that the Glazers were exploring cashing out on their ownership. Record 20-time English champions, Manchester United has over 650 million fans worldwide, according to market research firm Kantar. A large number of them have been clamouring for a change of ownership. That is because the Glazers have overseen a significant downturn in the club's fortunes, with the club winning just the last of their 20 top-flight titles in former manager Alex Ferguson's final season in charge in 2012-13. Manchester United won the League Cup under Erik ten Hag this season, but their third-place finish in the league, 14 points behind local rivals and treble winners Manchester City, underscores the scale of the turnaround required.

        "text": " MANCHESTER, England (AP) \u2014 Qatar's Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani is withdrawing his offer to buy storied soccer club Manchester United, a person with knowledge of the process told The Associated Press on Saturday. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality restrictions around the process. Sheikh Jassim had been one of the leading contenders to complete a takeover of the Premier League club, which was put up for sale last year. Along with British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, the Qatari banker was one of only two bidders to publicly declare their intention to buy out United owners, the Glazer family. But almost a year since bids were invited for the 20-time English league champions, Sheikh Jassim has informed the Glazers he is withdrawing his offer, the person said. The person said Sheikh Jassim's final bid was almost double United's current market valuation of $3.2 billion. Ratcliffe's offer remains in place, although it has been reported that he is prepared to accept a minority stake. The Associated Press contacted United and merchant bank Raine, which is handling the sale process, for comment. Sheikh Jassim's decision comes as United fans have grown increasingly frustrated with the time taken to complete the proposed sale. There have been fan protests outside the club's Old Trafford stadium, urging its American owners to sell, while chants of \u201cGlazers out\u201d are regularly heard during games. \u201cMUFC is in desperate need of new investment and new majority ownership. We hope this news accelerates that process rather than delays it,\u201d Manchester United Supporters Trust said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. \"Based on the last 11 months, no one can be quite sure. \u201cThe Glazers need to make their position clear.\u201d The Glazers announced in November plans to seek new investment, instructing Raine to oversee the process, which included the potential of a full sale. Raine had conducted the sale of Chelsea to Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital last year. It was anticipated a buyer would be confirmed in time for the off-season transfer window, but there has been no indication of a deal nearing completion. Sheikh Jassim, the chairman of Qatar Islamic Bank and son of a former Qatari prime minister, was bidding to take 100% ownership of United, which appealed to fans who are desperate to say goodbye to the Glazers. He also vowed to clear its debt, while investing in the stadium, training center and playing squads in a bid to \u201creturn the club to its former glories both on and off the pitch.\u201d While concerns had been raised about Qatar\u2019s human rights record and the potential that United could be used as a so-called sportswashing project, fans wanted to see the club compete with the exorbitant spending of Abu Dhabi-backed Manchester City, which completed a treble of trophies last season by winning the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup. The person said Sheikh Jassim's decision came after latest discussions to try to reach agreement over a price. His withdrawal would appear to leave Ratcliffe in pole position, although it is not clear how much of a stake in the club he is trying to buy. Ratcliffe, who is the owner of petrochemicals giant INEOS and is one of Britain\u2019s richest people, had bid for the Glazers\u2019 stake of about 69%, but reports later claimed the current owners could retain some of their shares as part of the takeover. Recent reports have since claimed Ratcliffe is now prepared to take a minority stake, which would leave the Glazers in control. Born in Failsworth, Greater Manchester, Ratcliffe has been a United fan since childhood. United supporters have long-hoped he would bid for the club, but a deal that involves the Glazers retaining a majority ownership would not be well-received by supporters who want a full sale. United fans have long campaigned to drive out the Glazers, who also own the NFL\u2019s Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The late tycoon Malcolm Glazer bought United in 2005 for 790 million pounds (then about $1.4 billion) amid a backlash from fans. United is currently 10th in the Premier League after a difficult start to the season for Erik ten Hag\u2019s team. ___ James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer"

        "text": " (This Oct. 14 story has been corrected to fix the word 'Sheikh' in the headline) By Anirban Sen and Mrinmay Dey (Reuters) - Qatar's Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al Thani has informed the Glazer family that controls Manchester United Plc that he will not improve on his bid to acquire the iconic soccer club for more than $6 billion, people familiar with the matter said. The move leaves the remaining bidder for Manchester United, Ineos Chair Jim Ratcliffe, in a stronger position. He has offered to buy only a 25% stake in the club, allowing some of the Glazers to cash out, and it remains unclear whether he will clinch an agreement. The exact value that Ratcliffe's bid infers on Manchester United could not be learned, but the sources said it was higher than Jassim's offer of more than $6 billion. Manchester United is currently valued by the stock market at $3.3 billion. Ratcliffe's deal, if finalised, could be announced later this month, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. Ratcliffe would oversee the team's operations and talent acquisition, while the Glazers will remain in charge of the commercial side of the business, according to the WSJ report. Jassim, who had also promised to invest more than $1.7 billion in Manchester United after he acquired it, still wants a deal but has informed the Glazer family that there is no point in remaining in the bidding process following nine months of unsuccessful negotiations, the sources said. Jassim would not have used any debt to acquire Manchester United and his bid would have paid down the club's existing debt pile, which net of cash totals more than $600 million, the sources added. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Representatives for Jassim declined to comment while Manchester United and Ratcliffe representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Sky News reported earlier on Saturday that Jassim was withdrawing from the bidding process. The Glazers' valuation expectations have been aggressive based on other soccer deals. Last year, the $3.1 billion acquisition of Chelsea Football Club by an investment group led by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital valued it at 5.7 times revenue for its last financial year. Valuing Manchester United more than Jassim's bid, at $7 billion for example, would be equivalent to 11 times the club's revenue over the last 12 months, according to LSEG data. The Glazer family, which made its fortune in real estate, retail and healthcare and also owns the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, bought the team for 790 million pounds ($960 million) in 2005. The six descendants of Malcolm Glazer, who died in 2014, together control 96% of Manchester United's voting stock. The club announced in November 2022 that the Glazers were exploring cashing out on their ownership. Record 20-time English champions, Manchester United has over 650 million fans worldwide, according to market research firm Kantar. A large number of them have been clamouring for a change of ownership. That is because the Glazers have overseen a significant downturn in the club's fortunes, with the club winning just the last of their 20 top-flight titles in former manager Alex Ferguson's final season in charge in 2012-13. Manchester United won the League Cup under Erik ten Hag this season, but their third-place finish in the league, 14 points behind local rivals and treble winners Manchester City, underscores the scale of the turnaround required.

        "text": " (Bloomberg) -- Colombia\u2019s central bank has room to lower interest rates by over five percentage points from the current level to 8% in 2024 as inflation continues to slow, Finance Minister Ricardo Bonilla said in an interview. Most Read from Bloomberg Israel Latest: Army Says Over 600,000 Gazans Have Fled South US Pushes Bid to Avert Wider Israel War After Iran Warning Israel Latest: Biden and Abbas Talk as Gaza Invasion Nears Your Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas War Global Markets Stable as US Pushes to Contain Middle East War Inflation has eased for six straight months, and if the trend continues, it could slow from 10.99% now to 9.2% in December and 5% in 2024, Bonilla said from the International Monetary Fund\u2019s annual meeting in Morocco. The government is being careful that fuel cost rises don\u2019t stoke consumer prices, he said. \u201cIf the trend goes like this, the central bank could cut rates from 13.25%, which is the current level, to 12.5% at the end of the year,\u201d said Bonilla, a voting member at the monetary policy committee. \u201cIt is expected that inflation will ease to 5% in 2024, and that the central bank will lower rates.\u201d Colombia targets inflation at 3%, with a tolerance range of between 2% and 4%. The Andean nation is home to one of Latin America\u2019s few remaining central banks that hasn\u2019t cut interest rates in recent weeks. Colombia\u2019s annual inflation has slowed from a peak, but it is still running almost four times above the official target. In September, policymakers kept borrowing costs unchanged at 13.25%, the highest level since 1999, in a rare split vote. Read more: Colombia Central Bank Defies Pressure, Holds 13.25% Key Rate Meanwhile, Brazil, Chile, and Peru, as well as smaller economies including Costa Rica, Uruguay, Paraguay, and the Dominican Republic have all started to ease monetary policy following post-pandemic rate hikes. Colombia\u2019s inflation will not ease as fast as in Chile or Brazil, as the Andean nation still has to increase fuel prices to close a gap caused by subsidies provided after the pandemic. Specifically, Bonilla said the government may have to increase gasoline costs for the next three or four months as oil jumps globally and will then begin gradual increases in diesel through 2025. Bonilla estimates the fiscal cost of fuel subsidies in 2024 will rise to 20 trillion pesos ($4.7 billion), of which 85% corresponds to diesel. Fiscal Stimulus Colombia\u2019s retail sales and manufacturing declined more than anticipated in July and August, indicating tight monetary policy has hurt activity. The finance minister maintained his economic growth forecast of 1.8% for this year after a 7.3% expansion in 2022, as the government will implement fiscal stimulus in housing and public works, he said, adding that gross domestic product could expand above 2% in 2024. The Colombian peso has advanced 14.5% year-to-date, the most among all emerging-market economies. However, over the past month, it has led global losses, showing how sensitive the currency is to global shocks. Bonilla said the government is showing investors fiscal responsibility by lowering debt levels and increasing fuel prices to close the budget gap, which should support the currency. \u201cI hope that the peso stays around 3,900 per dollar,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the last month, due to the instability of the United States and the growth of interest rates, the exchange rates in all Latin American countries changed.\u201d Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek The K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTS Introducing The Businessweek Show With Max Abelson Has Bob Iger Lost the Magic?

        "text": " (Bloomberg) -- The International Monetary Fund said that it sees no factors that would compel Japan to intervene in the foreign exchange market to support the yen. Most Read from Bloomberg Israel Latest: Army Says Over 600,000 Gazans Have Fled South US Pushes Bid to Avert Wider Israel War After Iran Warning Israel Latest: Biden and Abbas Talk as Gaza Invasion Nears Your Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas War Global Markets Stable as US Pushes to Contain Middle East War \u201cWe don\u2019t see any conditions,\u201d Sanjaya Panth, deputy director for IMF\u2019s Asia and Pacific Department, told reporters Saturday at the annual gathering of IMF and World Bank in Marrakech, Morocco. Pantha cautioned that he wasn\u2019t speaking on behalf of the Japanese authorities, who he said \u201cmay know things I don\u2019t\u201d about the situation. Panth said the yen\u2019s depreciation has been mostly driven by interest rate differentials, reflecting economic fundamentals as inflation rises elsewhere while the Bank of Japan sticks with its ultra-loose policy to generate stable inflation. He said the IMF isn\u2019t seeing key criteria that would support a need for intervention, namely dysfunction of markets, financial stability risks or de-anchoring of inflation expectations. Whether Japan will intervene to support the yen has been a key focus lately, with the currency staying near 150 per dollar. Panth\u2019s remarks come a day after Japan\u2019s top currency official sent a warning to traders, directly hinting at the possibility of intervention to Group of 20 counterparts if the yen moves excessively. Read More: Japan Finance Chief Sends Warning After Yen\u2019s Renewed Weakening The veteran IMF official refrained from forecasting the timing for the end of negative interest rate and a yield curve control. There are both upside and downside risks for Japan ranging from inflation expectations to the outlook of the global economy, Panth said. BOJ watchers are seeking clues on whether the bank will adjust its policy Oct. 31, with a widely expected upgrade in inflation outlook. Concerns over inflationary pressures have grown in global financial markets in the wake of a war between Israel and Hamas, which has been seen as a potential threat to oil markets if the conflict spreads through the region. \u201cWe\u2019re still talking about two more weeks, three more weeks, a lot of things are happening in the world,\u201d before the next BOJ meeting, Panth said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to try to predict what the Japanese authorities are going to do, except to say that I\u2019m quite confident that they\u2019ll look at it very carefully and make the right call.\u201d Some economists are now paying more attention to IMF\u2019s view on BOJ policy. In July, IMF Chief Economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said the BOJ should move away from the yield curve control a few days before the bank adjusted it in Governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s first surprise move. The IMF raised its forecasts for Japan\u2019s price gains this week, projecting that inflation in the world\u2019s third-largest economy will run much hotter than the BOJ\u2019s 2% target over the next year. Japan\u2019s key inflation measure has stayed above the price goal for a 17th month. Since the latest quarterly outlook report in July, the yen has weakened and oil prices have risen, boosting market expectations for the central bank to raise its projection again. \u201cThere\u2019s much more scope now than there has been for a very, very long time in Japan that inflation is going to remain 2% or the 2% target would be achieved,\u201d Panth said. \u201cThe probability of that happening has certainly increased much more than in the past.\u201d The IMF now sees Japan\u2019s consumer prices rising 3.2% this year and 2.9% in 2024, compared with 2.7% and 2.2%, respectively, forecast in April.

The loan, which would be directly to the government rather than to state utility Eskom, is \"under discussion\", Marie Francoise Marie-Nelly, the bank's director for South Africa, said in an interview in Marrakech, Morocco. \"It is going to come very soon,\" she added, declining to specify a timeframe.

Rolling power cuts have crimped economic growth, while fuelling private investment in renewable energy. \"It's a policy development loan which supports critical reforms,\" Marie-Nelly said of the potential World Bank funding. \"There's a particular focus on transmission, because it is a stumbling block in terms of bringing new (capacity) that is going to be built mainly by the private sector.\" In February, the South African government agreed to take on over 254 billion rand ($13.4 billion) of Eskom's debt through a debt relief scheme, subject to conditions. The main condition was that the power utility would not be able to take on any new debt for three years unless approved by the country's finance minister. In 2019, the government pledged to split Eskom into three subsidiaries - transmission, generation and distribution. Eskom said in August that its transmission arm would not be operational until 2025. The World Bank loan would also support South Africa to make a \"just transition\" away from coal, to ensure vulnerable people do not suffer as a result, Marie-Nelly said. She said the government was \"also looking at the broader climate agenda, including looking at the carbon tax.\" In November 2022, the World Bank approved $497 million in financing to decommission and repurpose one of Eskom's coal-fired power plants.

That gathering saw a close-run decision to raise interest rates for a 10th consecutive time, with a pledge to keep them high and further increases not ruled out. \u201cWage growth is expected to decline gradually, albeit remaining high over the projection horizon, driven by increases in minimum wages and inflation compensation in a context of tight, though cooling, labor markets,\u201d she said. Revisiting a theme touched on during a panel discussion on Friday, Lagarde suggested that assessing the impact of prior increases in rates remains crucial. \u201cDownside risks include weaker demand, due for example to a stronger transmission of monetary policy or to a worsening of the international economic environment,\u201d she said. Lagarde offered a similar view on prospects for expansion. \u201cGrowth could be slower if the effects of monetary policy turn out to be more forceful than expected, or if the world economy weakens further and geopolitical risks intensify,\u201d she said. \u201cGrowth could also be higher than projected if the strong labor market, rising real incomes and receding uncertainty boost confidence among consumers and businesses and lead them to spend more.\u201d Speaking later to an audience of central bankers hosted by the Group of 30, Lagarde stressed that the ECB hasn\u2019t yet reached the moment where it can declare mission accomplished. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of being hawkish or dovish, but it requires us at this point in time to be patient, as supply shocks reverse and new shocks arrive, and be attentive to ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored when inflation is still too high,\u201d she said.

        "text": " MARRAKECH, Morocco (Reuters) - Overshadowed by fresh Middle East violence and hosted by a country still recovering from an earthquake, the week-long annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank wrapped up on Saturday. Discussions in the Moroccan city of Marrakech ranged from the prospects for a world economy weighed down by debt, inflation and conflict to the growing wealth gap between rich and poor countries and floundering efforts to tackle climate change. Here are the main takeaways: \"LIMPING\" ECONOMY The new IMF outlook - signed off before the escalation of the conflict between Israel and Hamas - sees global economic growth slowing from 3.5% last year to 3% this year and 2.9% next year, a 0.1% point downgrade from a previous 2024 estimate. Global inflation is seen dropping from 6.9% this year to a still-high 5.8% next. Central bankers signalled readiness to end interest rate hikes if events allow, hopeful that inflation can be finally tamed without too hard a landing. Most agreed it was too early to say how Middle East strife would affect a global economy which IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas described as \"limping along, not sprinting\". DEBT SQUEEZE The heavy debt burdens of advanced economies - from the United States to China and Italy - was a recurrent theme in the meetings, which came after financial markets in recent weeks pushed U.S. bond yields higher. Italian central bank governor Ignazio Visco said there was an impression markets were \"reevaluating the term premium\" as investors become more nervous about holding longer term debt. JPMorgan chair of global research Joyce Chang put it another way. \"The bond vigilantes are back, and the Great Moderation is over,\" she told a panel of the two-decade era of relative economic calm before the 2008/09 financial crisis. One policy area where this could have a knock-on effect is the fight against climate change. Vitor Gaspar, head of the IMF's fiscal division, warned current subsidies-based policies were failing to deliver net zero emissions and that scaling them up would explode public debt. \"Countries will need a new mix of policies with carbon pricing at the centre,\" the Fund concluded. DEBT DEALS AND REFORMS Looking beyond the major developed economies, higher policy rates, a strong dollar and geopolitical uncertainties are adding to challenges for the rest of the world. Turkey was in the spotlight as Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek pitched its reform plan. \"The biggest structural issue is to bring inflation down. And they're working on it,\" said Murat Ulgen, Global Head of Emerging Markets Research at HSBC. Kenya is looking to avoid slipping into debt distress and its central bank governor told Reuters it plans a buyback of a quarter of its $2 billion international bond maturing in June - pushing its 2024 bond up 1.2 cents on the dollar. One debt restructuring deal emerged: Zambia finally agreed a debt rework memorandum of understanding with creditors including China and France. Progress on Sri Lanka was less clear. Sri Lanka said on Thursday it reached an agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China covering about $4.2 billion of debt, while talks with other official creditors are stalling. RISKS SKEWED TO DOWNSIDE High interest rates will put some borrowers in more precarious positions, the IMF warned in its Global Financial Stability Report. Around 5% of banks globally are vulnerable to stress if those rates remain higher for longer, it estimated, and a further 30% of banks - including some of the world's largest - would be vulnerable if the global economy enters a prolonged period of low growth and high inflation. JOSTLING FOR INFLUENCE The Ukraine war, growing trade protectionism and tensions between the United States and China are all making consensus-building tougher: In the end, there was not enough agreement to issue the usual final communique at the end of the meetings. There was much talk ahead of Marrakech on revamping the IMF and World Bank to better reflect the emergence of economies like China and Brazil. A U.S. proposal to boost IMF lending power but save a review of shareholdings in the fund till later won broad support. A pact announced on Saturday spoke of a \"meaningful increase\" in quotas by end-2023 but gave few other details. Anti-poverty groups were sceptical of what had been achieved. \"The big theme this week is G7 countries papering over the cracks of shattered promises,\" said Kate Donald, Head of Oxfam International's Washington DC Office. \"Despite the wringing of hands about the billions of dollars needed to tackle poverty and climate breakdown, there has been no sign of new money.\" (Reporting in Marrakech by Ahmed El Jechtimi, Andrea Shalal, David Lawder, Leika Kihara, Elisa Martinuzzi, Rachel Savage, Jorgelina do Rosario, Balazs Koranyi; Compiled by Mark John; Editing by Christina Fincher)"

        "text": " By Leika Kihara MARRAKECH, Morocco (Reuters) -The yen's recent declines are driven by fundamentals and do not meet any of the considerations that would call for authorities to intervene in the currency market, a senior International Monetary Fund official said on Saturday. \"On the yen, our sense is that the exchange rate is driven pretty much by fundamentals. As long as interest rate differentials remain, the yen will continue to face pressure,\" Sanjaya Panth, deputy director of the IMF's Asia and Pacific Department, told reporters. Authorities in Japan are facing renewed pressure to combat a sustained depreciation in the yen, as investors bet on higher-for-longer U.S. interest rates while the Bank of Japan remains wedded to its super low interest rate policy. The IMF sees foreign exchange intervention as justified only when there is a severe dysfunction in the market, a heightening of financial stability risks, or a de-anchoring of inflation expectations, Panth said. \"I don't think any of the three considerations are existing right now,\" he said, when asked whether recent yen falls call for authorities to intervene in the currency market. Japan bought yen in September and October last year, its first foray in the market to boost the currency since 1998, to stem sharp declines that eventually pushed the yen to a 32-year low of 151.94 to the dollar. The dollar fetched 149.57 yen on Friday. The BOJ has been a dovish outlier among a wave of central banks raising interest rates, even as cost-driven price rises have kept inflation above its 2% target for more than a year. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has stressed the need to keep rates ultra-low until inflation durably stays around 2% backed by robust demand and sustained wage increases. Panth said there were more upside than downside risks to Japan's near-term inflation outlook as the economy was running near full capacity, and price rises were increasingly driven by solid demand. But he said it was \"not yet the time\" for the BOJ to raise short-term rates due to uncertainty on how slowing global demand could affect Japan's export-reliant economy. In the meantime, the BOJ should continue to take steps that allow long-term interest rates to move more flexibly to lay the groundwork for an eventual monetary tightening, he said. The BOJ guides short-term rates at -0.1%. It also sets a 0% target for the 10-year bond yield under its yield curve control (YCC) policy. As rising inflation put upward pressure on yields, the bank loosened its tight grip on long-term rates by raising a de-facto cap for the yield in December last year and July. \"What it did in December and July to increase flexibility on long end of the yield curve, was very much steps in the right direction,\" Panth said.

        "text": " (Adds quotes, details from IMF steering committee statement) By David Lawder and Andrea Shalal MARRAKECH, Morocco, Oct 14 (Reuters) - International Monetary Fund countries on Saturday failed to agree on a U.S.-backed plan to boost IMF funding without giving more shares to China and other big emerging markets, but pledged a \"meaningful increase\" in lending resources by year-end. As IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Morocco closed, a statement from IMF's steering committee chair called for new quota contributions that would \"at least maintain the Fund's current resource envelope\" as $185 billion worth of bilateral borrowing arrangements expire. Quotas, contributed by member countries in proportion to their shareholding, make up only about 40% of the IMF's roughly $1 trillion in lending firepower , and the Fund says a larger proportion of quotas would provide more lending certainty as economic shocks grow. CHINA PUSHBACK The U.S. Treasury plan for countries to contribute new quota funds in proportion to their current shareholdings -- unchanged since 2010 -- had won support from G7 countries, India and a number of other emerging markets. China, whose economy is now three times the size it was in 2010, continued to push for more IMF shares. People's Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng said in a statement to the IMFC meeting that Beijing wanted both a quota increase and a realignment of shares \"to reflect members\u2019 relative weights in the global economy, and strengthen the voice and representation of emerging markets and developing countries.\" IMFC members agreed to add a third IMF Executive Board chair to represent African countries, a key sweetener for the U.S. \"equi-proportional quota plan. Pan said China supported this move but it was a separate issue from the shareholding formula. The IMFC chair's statement left the door open to a possible adoption of the U.S. money now-shares later plan, noting that \"transitional arrangements\" may be needed. It also called for the IMF's Executive Board to propose options for changes to the shareholding formula by June 2025. This would accelerate the next five-year review of quotas and meet IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva's call for a deadline on adjusting its shareholding to preserve its credibility. A U.S. Treasury official told reporters that despite no firm agreement, there was good progress on the quota issue, with countries talking through their positions and a deal \"increasingly likely\" by October. WAR CLOUDS Forging a deal to boost the IMF's $1 trillion in lending firepower to enable it to respond to another large scale economic crisis was one of the biggest tasks for Georgieva at the meetings in the desert tourist hub of Marrakech overshadowed somewhat. The IMFC's chair, Spanish economy minister Nadia Calvino, said members were again unable to reach consensus on a joint communique amid disagreements over conflict language, despite many member countries condemning both Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the killing of civilians in both Israel and Gaza. But the week was overshadowed by the growing conflict between Israel and Gaza, and Georgieva closed the event with an ominous warning that it was adding to global economic uncertainty. \"I can say the shock people have felt, it came in our meetings,\" Georgieva said, noting that these sentiments shifted from attacks on \"innocent civilians\" in Israel to \"the necessity to now find ways to prevent the loss of civilian lives in Gaza.\" \"What we see, of course, is a recognition that this is yet another source of uncertainty,\" she said, adding that much would depend on its scope and duration. The World Bank's governing body also was unable to issue a joint communique, though it noted in a statement Development Committee Chair United Arab Emirates that \"most members\" supported G20 leaders' language on the war in Ukraine. The Development Committee formally endorsed the World Bank's new vision \"to create a world free of poverty on a livable planet,\" aimed at expanding its mission to climate change, pandemics, fragile states and other global challenges.

        "text": " (Bloomberg) -- Investors are growing more confident that a year-long slump in profits for Corporate America is about to end. Yet a fragile economic outlook, wary consumers and the highest interest rates in 16 years mean any relief for stocks could be short-lived. Most Read from Bloomberg Israel Latest: Army Says Over 600,000 Gazans Have Fled South US Pushes Bid to Avert Wider Israel War After Iran Warning Israel Latest: Biden and Abbas Talk as Gaza Invasion Nears Your Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas War Global Markets Stable as US Pushes to Contain Middle East War Analysts predict the companies in the S&P 500 will report a 1.2% drop in third-quarter earnings \u2014 the fourth straight decline \u2014 before a 6.5% rebound in the final three months of the year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. Unusually, estimates have risen going into the reporting season, a sign of confidence that has lifted the S&P 500 by 0.9% in October after back-to-back monthly drops. If companies surpass those predictions, as they usually do, third-quarter earnings may even increase. \u201cA slightly better outlook for S&P 500 earnings should finally emerge in the third quarter, but the recovery is still fragile and lacks breadth,\u201d said Gina Martin Adams, chief equity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. While the momentum of estimate revisions has picked up, margins outside the energy sector \u201cneed to firm\u201d and the outlook for sectors sensitive to the economic cycle needs to improve \u201cfor stocks to derive confidence,\u201d she said. That confidence may be hard to come by. Shoppers and companies alike are feeling the pinch from higher interest rates, while the economy in China \u2014 long an engine of growth for the world \u2014 is struggling to get in gear. Even luxury goods-makers such as LVMH are warning of slowing demand after holding up under high inflation. And the conflict between Israel and Hamas has the potential to disrupt the world economy. Here\u2019s a look at some themes investors will be focused on as they parse earnings reports. Consumer Spending A key determinant of whether the earnings recovery can last is the US consumer. Spending is likely to take a hit as Covid-era savings are depleted and payments resume on federal student loans. The surge in interest rates means credit card debt could double in the next three to four years, according to data from the Federal Reserve. Consumer spending rose just 0.1% in August after adjusting for inflation, the weakest since March. The risk is higher for retailers that cater to low-to-middle-income consumers as they\u2019re more sensitive to any rise in inflation. Denim brand Levi Strauss & Co. last week cut its full-year sales outlook, citing a squeeze on shoppers, while auto retailer CarMax Inc. tumbled as analysts voiced concerns about consumers\u2019 ability to afford cars. But even sales of high-end goods are losing steam, as LVMH showed this week. Still, there are some bright spots. Fast Retailing Co., the Japanese owner of clothing retailer Uniqlo, issued an upbeat forecast on the back of robust sales in both its home and overseas markets, while Nike Inc. shares jumped on strong demand. Interest Rates The most aggressive policy tightening by the Federal Reserve since the 1980s has left Corporate America facing much higher costs of debt. Interest costs could climb by more than $80 billion cumulatively by the end of 2026 for issuers of dollar-denominated debt with fixed-rate exposure, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Borrowers in the financial sector account for almost half of the total, while Apple Inc., AbbVie Inc. and Boeing Co. face more than half a billion dollars each in higher interest expenses, BI strategist Noel Hebert wrote in a note. With latest data showing both producer and consumer prices remain elevated, investors have trimmed wagers of a dovish tilt in Fed policy. That\u2019s likely to add pressure on profit margins just months after analysts\u2019 projections began to improve. At the same time, some industries are facing strikes from workers seeking higher pay, further adding to corporate costs. \u201cIt takes a while for the impact of inflation and interest rates to come through,\u201d said Murdo MacLean, client investment manager at Walter Scott & Partners Ltd. in Edinburgh. \u201cAnd it\u2019s still coming through and it will still come through next year and the year after. We expect consumers to be tightening their belts, no question.\u201d Resilient Estimates One bright spot is that analysts have been more confident about profit growth. S&P 500 earnings-per-share estimates for the third quarter were revised up 0.1% in the past three months, compared with a typical cut of 4%, according to Bank of America Corp. That\u2019s the first time since the fourth quarter of 2021 that forecasts weren\u2019t reduced ahead of the reporting period, the data showed. As broader US economic growth remains resilient, some market forecasters are counting on companies to beat those estimates at a higher-than-average pace. BofA strategists Ohsung Kwon and Savita Subramanian said they expect a \u201csizeable\u201d 4% beat rate compared with a typical rate of 2% as inventories fall and earnings outpace growth in gross domestic product. That\u2019s at odds with findings of a recent Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey, which found respondents were bracing for a slew of profit warnings this season due to the impact of higher yields. Reports from companies have been mixed. While PepsiCo Inc. raised its 2023 earnings forecast as consumers absorbed higher prices, Delta Air Lines Inc. cut the high end of its outlook, partly due to higher fuel prices. Weight-Loss Drugs While artificial intelligence set markets atwitter earlier in 2023, now weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy are all the rage. Sales of the appetite-suppressing medications \u2014 known as GLP-1s \u2014 have skyrocketed and upended the market for everything from snacks to booze and medical devices. Novo Nordisk A/S, the maker of the treatments, on Friday raised its outlook for revenue and profit once again. While some companies such Pringles maker Kellanova have said it\u2019s too early to assess the effect of the drugs on consumer behavior, Walmart Inc. said it\u2019s already seeing an impact on shopping demand. Third-quarter earnings will provide some clues as to whether an index of food stocks, already down 26% from a May high, has farther to fall. \u201cWe believe that the impact will be gradual and the stock selloff in many packaged food companies is way overdone, with any actual slow-down in consumption coming over the next 3-5 years,\u201d said Jay Hatfield, chief executive officer at Infrastructure Capital Management. China Impact Another theme this season will be the impact of a choppy economic recovery in China. Signals from the monthly data for industrial profits, manufacturing activity and tourism revenue have been encouraging, but bank margins will likely come under pressure as the country cuts interest rates. \u201cIndustrials and materials earnings will be impacted by producer price deflation and in general weak demand,\u201d said Marvin Chen, a strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cWe expect the trend to be similar to 2Q. Tech earnings may do fairly well, driven by cost-cutting measures.\u201d Few market participants expect big positive surprises from the property sector as developers struggle with tepid demand and try to cut debt levels. Suppliers to Huawei Technologies Co. could be a bright spot after the launch of its Mate 60 Pro smart-phone in August, which is expected to boost orders even into next year. Among international markets, Europe is more exposed to China than the US is, given that its miners, luxury goods-makers and automakers rely on the Asian nation for a chunk of their revenue. --With assistance from Ishika Mookerjee, April Ma, Jan-Patrick Barnert and Julien Ponthus.

        "text": " NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 As more children emerge from the pandemic grappling with mental health issues, their parents are seeking ways for them to build emotional resilience. And toy companies are paying close attention. While still in its early phase, a growing number of toy marketers are embracing MESH \u2014 or mental, emotional and social health \u2014 as a designation for toys that teach kids skills like how to adjust to new challenges, resolve conflict, advocate for themselves, or solve problems. The acronym was first used in child development circles and by the American Camp Association 10 years ago and gained new resonance after the pandemic. Rachele Harmuth, head of ThinkFun, a division of toy company Ravensburger, and resilience expert and family physician Deborah Gilboa, formed a MESH taskforce earlier this year with the goal of getting manufacturers to design toys with emotional resilience in mind and to have retailers market them accordingly. \u201cWe just need to educate parents and educators just a little bit to know that we could be using their play time a little bit intentionally,\u201d Gilboa said. The plan is to certify MESH toys by mid-2024 the same way the Toy Association did for STEAM toys, which emphasize science, tech, engineering, arts, and math. Adrienne Appell, a spokeswoman at the Toy Association, notes that MESH is an area it will continue to monitor as it evolves. Many toys that could be considered MESH happen to already be in children\u2019s toy chests \u2014 like memory games, puppets, certain types of Legos, Pok\u00e9mon trading games, and Dungeons & Dragons. The concept was highlighted at the toy industry\u2019s recent four-day annual show in New York, which featured an abundance of toys from the likes of hand2mind and Open the Joy that encourage children to express their feelings with mirrors or puppets. James Zahn, editor- in-chief of the trade publication the Toy Book, noted the bulk of the new toys being developed with MESH in mind will be out starting next year. But some worry the MESH approach might end up promising parents something it can't deliver. There\u2019s also a risk of companies preying on parents\u2019 anxieties about their kids\u2019 mental health. \u201cMy fear is that MESH will be used as the next marketing gimmick,\u201d said Chris Byrne, an independent toy analyst. \u201cIt will create a culture of fear that their children are not developing socially and emotionally. And that\u2019s not really the job of the toy industry. \u201d Experts say childhood depression and anxiety were climbing for years, but the pandemic\u2019s unrelenting stress and grief magnified the woes, particularly for those already grappling with mental health issues who were cut off from counselors and other school resources during remote learning. Many educators began emphasizing social emotional learning in response, which teaches children soft skills like helping them manage their emotions and create positive rapport with others. Dave Anderson, vice president of school and community programs and a senior psychologist in the ADHD and Behavior Disorders Center at the Child Mind Institute, applauded the toy industry\u2019s efforts to likewise address emotional resilience. But he said parents need to be careful about claims that companies may be making. While there\u2019s evidence that skills highlighted by the MESH taskforce can build resilience, there\u2019s no evidence that the toys themselves will, he said. \u201cThe concepts are evidence based; the toys themselves are not,\u201d he said. Bryne notes that the skills being highlighted by the MESH taskforce are the basics of play, whether it\u2019s skateboarding that builds perseverance or learning how to share toys to help with conflict resolution. \u201cIn my opinion, if you live in a healthy home and you\u2019re having healthy play and your parents are engaged, the MESH stuff kind of happens automatically, \u201d he said. The U.S. toy industry itself has been in need of a jolt following a weak year, particularly a lackluster holiday 2022 season when retailers were stuck with a surplus of toys after enjoying a pandemic-induced toy splurge by parents. The malaise has continued so far this year, with toy sales in the U.S. down 8% from January through August, based on Circana\u2019s retail tracking service data. For its part, the MESH taskforce is initially working with specialty stores like Learning Express and small toy companies like Crazy Aaron\u2019s, which has expanded beyond its Thinking Putty to add activity kits that teach kids problem solving like how magnets work with putty. One game ThinkFun is marketing: Rush Hour, a sliding block logic game that has kids battle traffic gridlock. But large retailers like Amazon are also waking up to the MESH approach. \u201cThe rising popularity of MESH toys speaks to the power of play and the important role that toys play in our lives,\" said Anne Carrihill, Amazon\u2019s director of toys and games. Richard Derr, owner of the Learning Express franchise in Lake Zurich, Illinois, said that he trained his workers on helping parents this past spring to pick the right toys. But the challenge is not to scare parents. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to rush up to somebody and say, \u2018Hey, how\u2019s your mental health today of your kids?\u2019\u201d Derr said. \u201cThat\u2019s why local toy stores are a great place to start because of our relationships with the community, customers and teachers.\u201d But he noted toymakers can\u2019t be overusing the word MESH without any meaning. Sarah Davis, the mother of three boys ages 3, 6 and 9, is open to the idea of MESH toys. The Great Falls, Virginia resident said her 6-year-old had delayed speech because he was wearing a mask during the heart of the pandemic, while her 9-year-old son has some issues with social interaction after being isolated and glued to his laptop. \u201cMy kids don\u2019t have an issue with anxiety in terms of school,\" she said, but added. \u201dI still worry about the long-term effects of what that was like.\u201d More than the promise of building emotional resilience through MESH is whether the toys themselves will actually be fun. \u201cAre my kids going to ask for those kind of toys for Christmas?\u201d Davis asked. \u201cI\u2019m going to be really curious and I will keep an eye out for them.\u201d ________ Follow Anne D\u2019Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio ___ This story has been updated to correct the name of the Toy Association."

        "text": " (Bloomberg) -- With the Securities and Exchange Commission opting against appealing a ruling that paves the way for Grayscale Investments LLC to convert its Bitcoin trust into an exchange-traded fund, analysts are now trying to gauge how the process may unfold from here. Most Read from Bloomberg Israel Latest: Army Says Over 600,000 Gazans Have Fled South US Pushes Bid to Avert Wider Israel War After Iran Warning Israel Latest: Biden and Abbas Talk as Gaza Invasion Nears Your Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas War Global Markets Stable as US Pushes to Contain Middle East War The crypto asset-manager earlier this year scored a legal victory in federal court in its bid to turn its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (ticker GBTC) into the first US ETF that would invest directly in the largest digital coin. The SEC faced a Friday deadline to appeal the ruling. The agency is not planning any other appeals in the case, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing the ongoing matter. What\u2019s likely to occur is that dialog between Grayscale and the SEC is going to open up, according to James Seyffart, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cWe\u2019ll get more information next week and then we\u2019ll know what happens next,\u201d he said. Seyffart added that the regulator has the option to file an appeal with the Supreme Court, though he views that as highly unlikely to happen. The SEC didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on the agency\u2019s plans for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Grayscale has argued that a conversion of GBTC into an ETF could unlock billions in value for its holders. Its court win was seen as monumental for the industry because it sparked excitement within the digital-assets community that a Bitcoin ETF could, after a decade-long battle, finally be had in the US. The SEC had been hesitant in the past to give a green-light. But there are currently a slew of companies, including BlackRock Inc. and Invesco, among others, trying to get such a product launched. Immediately following the Grayscale ruling in August, shares of GBTC rallied more than did Bitcoin itself, with the trust\u2019s discount to its underlying holdings narrowing significantly.

A key remaining question is whether the regulator will allow multiple Bitcoin ETFs to launch all at once.

        "text": " (Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve officials look set to hold interest rates steady for the second time in a row next month \u2014 but they\u2019re far from calling an end to their tightening campaign. Most Read from Bloomberg Israel Latest: Army Says Over 600,000 Gazans Have Fled South US Pushes Bid to Avert Wider Israel War After Iran Warning Israel Latest: Biden and Abbas Talk as Gaza Invasion Nears Your Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas War Global Markets Stable as US Pushes to Contain Middle East War Policymakers across the hawk-dove spectrum have signaled in recent days that they\u2019re inclined to forgo a rate hike at their Oct. 31-Nov. 1 meeting following a run-up in bond yields that has tightened financial conditions. But with data on the labor market and inflation showing an economy that\u2019s still humming, the Federal Open Market Committee is unlikely to take further rate increases off the table. \u201cIt\u2019s too soon to declare victory,\u201d Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who has a rotating vote on rates this year, said Tuesday during a town hall event in North Dakota. Minutes from the Fed\u2019s September gathering released Wednesday showed policymakers see a slew of risks that could push inflation higher than they expect, including shocks to food prices, a stronger housing market and a slowdown in the decline of goods prices. An anticipated ground war between Israel and Hamas also threatens to keep energy prices elevated, which could feed into more inflation pressures. Recent economic data also highlighted a resilient economy despite the Fed raising rates more than five percentage points since March 2022. Hiring surged last month as employers added 336,000 jobs \u2014 double the number estimated by economists, and the most since the start of the year. Producer prices rose more than forecast, and core inflation excluding shelter and energy services \u2014 a measure closely watched by Chair Jerome Powell \u2014 also picked up. The repeated \u201chead fakes\u201d in the economic data will make policymakers wary of signaling an end to further tightening, said Priya Misra, a portfolio manager at JP Morgan Investment Management in New York. \u201cWhenever they are done, I don\u2019t think they will say they are done,\u201d Misra said. \u201cThey will want to keep the expectation or optionality to hike.\u201d Fed officials are increasingly focused on trying to balance the risk of overshooting \u2014 and triggering a possible recession \u2014 against the need to get inflation back to target. They\u2019re also wary of making the same mistake as the Bank of Canada, which in June had to restart its rate-increase campaign after a conditional pause, citing \u201cexcess demand\u201d that was more persistent than anticipated. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly called it the hardest phase of policymaking, as officials try to communicate how they are straddling two-sided risks. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t know exactly what will be needed, it\u2019s not actually a terrific idea to telegraph one thing or the other,\u201d she said on Oct. 5. \u201cWe could find ourselves with data that are really accelerating, and I don\u2019t want to be in a position where we\u2019ve said definitively we\u2019re not going to do X, and then X is needed.\u201d Yield Surge Nevertheless, a fast rise in bond yields after the Sept. 19-20 policy meeting has led some officials to conclude that they can skip a hike for the second consecutive meeting as higher market rates are doing some of the work of restraint. Philip Jefferson, who as vice chair plays a key role in communicating Fed policy on behalf of Powell, said Monday he\u2019s watching the increase in Treasury yields as a potential further brake on the economy. \u201cLooking ahead, I will remain cognizant of the tightening in financial conditions through higher bond yields and will keep that in mind as I assess the future path of policy,\u201d he said. Yields on the US government 10-year note touched the highest levels since 2007 on Oct. 6 before closing at 4.8%. As Fed officials signaled a November hike might be off the table, yields fell back, closing the week at 4.61%. Read More: Fed Leaders See Rise in Yields as Possible Substitute for Hike \u201cWe\u2019re in this position where we kind of watch and see what happens,\u201d Fed Governor Christopher Waller said Wednesday at a conference in Park City, Utah. Others, including Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker and Atlanta Fed chief Raphael Bostic, have gone further, saying policy is restrictive enough to guide inflation back to the central bank\u2019s 2% goal. But such a clear signal is unlikely to come from the Fed\u2019s policy committee. In projections submitted just last month, 12 of 19 officials said they expect another rate increase before the end of the year. While policymakers could at some point tweak their post-meeting statement \u2014 which referenced \u201cthe extent of additional policy firming\u201d \u2014 the data haven\u2019t yet indicated that the inflation battle is over. The last reading on the Fed\u2019s preferred core inflation measure showed prices rose 3.9% in the 12 months through August. Communication Risks A strong signal that the rate-hiking cycle is over risks a powerful rally in stock and bond markets, inducing more consumption and growth just when Fed officials are trying to moderate demand. Households seem to believe that the inflation fight is far from convincingly won. Both short- and longer-run inflation expectations moved higher this month, a University of Michigan survey showed Friday. \u201cThey can\u2019t signal they are done,\u201d said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP LLC, because it immediately sets up expectations of when the Fed will start cutting. Fed officials also see it as essential to keep a lid on inflation expectations, and have repeatedly emphasized their commitment to restoring price stability, even if it means raising rates higher than they currently expect. \u201cTwo percent is and will remain our inflation target,\u201d Powell said in his Aug. 25 remarks at the Jackson Hole, Wyoming, central bank symposium. The Fed chief is set to speak Thursday at the Economic Club of New York. Lifting the threat of further hikes could also undermine that credibility with the public, raising the risk that inflation will become entrenched. \u201cThere is a very substantial risk that they will need to do more,\u201d said Andrew Levin, a former senior Fed adviser who\u2019s now a professor at Dartmouth College.

The real estate market in many regions has \u201cshown signs of recovery\u201d following the relaxation of mortgage rules, Pan said. China\u2019s local government debt risk is \u201cstructural and generally manageable,\u201d he said. The country will improve the business environment for private firms and step up efforts to attract foreign investment and stabilize trade, he said, without announcing any specific new measures. Monetary policy will make better use of both aggregate and structural tools, Pan said according to a separate statement from the PBOC, referring to broad moves that affect overall liquidity and targeted ones to aid certain industries. China will seek more sustainable growth while maintaining a \u201creasonable\u201d expansion pace, he said. Global central bankers and finance minsters have gathered in Marrakech to discuss the outlook for the world economy amid rising geopolitical tensions \u2014 including a new war in the Middle East. In one of his highest-profile overseas trips since taking office in July, the governor on Friday met Janet Yellen for talks that a Treasury spokesman described as \u201csubstantive and productive.\u201d Official data on Friday showed consumer prices unexpectedly slowed to the brink of deflation, though other recent indicators such as exports have suggested the slowdown may be moderating. Authorities have so far avoided rolling out a significant stimulus package to boost the economy and instead have focused on more incremental policies. Pan said China\u2019s financial sector remains resilient and risks are \u201cwell under control.\u201d China will strictly control new borrowing by local government financing vehicles and set up a mechanism to rein in their debt expansion. Economically more developed eastern provinces are able to resolve their local government debt issues on their own, Pan said. Provinces in central and western regions can restructure their financing platforms, sell assets to repay debt and negotiate with financial institutions, he said. On debt restructuring talks with low-income countries, Pan said China has played an active role in addressing global debt distress and made important contributions to the debt treatment of Zambia. Pan also said he hopes the IMF\u2019s quota review will increase the voice and representation of developing countries. Quota realignment is fundamental to IMF governance reform, he said. Other highlights of Pan\u2019s speech: \u201cYouth employment has significantly improved,\u201d Pan said, adding that overall employment is stable China\u2019s fiscal expenditure has increased at a faster but reasonable pace, while the issuance of special local government bonds \u2014 a major source of infrastructure funding \u2014 has picked up Global inflation may stay higher for longer, though China\u2019s consumer prices remain stable Global financial stability risks are on the rise, and monetary policy uncertainties are increasing due to complex trends in major economies (Updates with additional comments.)

        "text": " * 'Electricity, food, water crisis,' says Gaza resident * People surge to south Gaza after Israeli warning * U.N. calls to 'avert a humanitarian catastrophe' * Israel says it told people to head south for safety By Nidal al-Mughrabi GAZA, Oct 14 (Reuters) - As an unrelenting Israeli bombardment intensified on Saturday, bakeries in Gaza were running out of bread, drinking water was in short supply and power outages left families without charged phones to find out if fleeing relatives were safe. \"There is an electricity crisis, food crisis, water crisis, a crisis of everything,\" Eyad Abu Mutlaq, 45, said in Khan Younis in south Gaza, a region filling up with thousands of people fleeing the north for fear of an Israeli invasion. \"It is only God who can resolve it,\" he said after touring four bakeries to find long queues or no supplies. The flood of people arriving in south Gaza after Israel told them on Friday to leave an area in the north has stretched resources that were already strained to breaking point. The United Nations has urged Israel to \"avert a humanitarian catastrophe\" in Gaza, a slither of land with 2.3 million people wedged between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. In its response to the devastating Oct. 7 assault from Gaza by Palestinian militant group Hamas, Israel has imposed a \"total blockade\" halting food supplies and cutting electricity to Gaza. A week after that began, shops are running out of many items. \"I was looking for basic food, eggs, rice, canned food, even milk for the children and I couldn\u2019t find them,\" said Khan Younis resident, giving only her nickname of Um Salem. \"This is how Israel is fighting us, through starvation of our children. They either kill children by bombs or soon by starvation.\" Israel said it had told people to leave the north for their safety and to ensure they were not caught up in the conflict. It said it would guarantee the safety of Palestinians fleeing the area on two main roads until 4 p.m. (1300 GMT) on Friday. Those who have fled say many roads and streets are often difficult to use, and some impassable, because of damage. APPEAL TO END THE 'SIEGE' Gaza authorities said 70 people were killed and 200 were wounded when Israel struck cars and trucks carrying people fleeing the north. Reuters could not independently verify this. The Hamas assault last week killed more than 1,300 Israelis. The fighters also took scores of hostages in the worst breach of Israel's defences since its creation in 1948. The death toll from Israel's response was more than 2,200 people by Saturday. Without the option of crossing the border into Egypt, more of Gaza's population has been cramming into the south seeking shelter, as Israel builds up troops and tanks on border. Israel has already launched raids. \"We need to truck fuel into Gaza now. Fuel is the only way for people to have safe drinking water. If not, people will start dying of severe dehydration, among them young children, the elderly and women,\" said Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of the U.N. refugee agency UNRWA,. \"Water is now the last remaining lifeline. I appeal for the siege on humanitarian assistance to be lifted now,\" he said. U.S. President Joe Biden said on Friday he was making it a priority to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, working with Israel, Egypt, Jordan, other Arab states and the U.N. He said he was also ensuring Israel had what it needed to respond to the Oct. 7 attack, including bringing any U.S. hostages home. The Gaza authorities have reported 10,000 people injured so far in the bombardment. Hospitals are struggling to cope. Gaza Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qidra said hospitals were running low of medical supplies and fuel to keep going. More than 1,695 buildings and high-rise towers have been destroyed in the Israeli airstrikes, in addition to 7,000 housing units, the Hamas government media office said. With power cuts and no fuel to operate generators, Adel Shaheen has been charging people's phones with his solar panels during daylight hours. \"We don't see the electricity anymore and if we want to charge a mobile we have to wait for the sun, otherwise we have no electricity at all,\u201d he said. \"People want to charge (mobile phones) so they can make calls to check on their families.\" But he said most Gazans were now \"cut off from the world\".

Multiple attendees at the International Monetary Fund\u2019s meetings this week cautioned that the wholesale tightening now risks inflicting a shock to a world economy already on edge as war rages in the Middle East. \u201cDebt levels are at record high levels at the same time that we\u2019re in this higher-for-longer interest-rate environment,\u201d Gita Gopinath, the No. 2 official at the IMF, told a panel hosted by Bloomberg\u2019s Tom Keene. \u201cThere is a lot for us to watch carefully \u2014 and that could go wrong.\u201d She and peers gathered in the Moroccan city of Marrakech don\u2019t need to stretch their minds back far for an example. Their nerves were tested this year with a string of regional US bank collapses, followed by real estate jitters that have yet to dissipate. Read more: Yield Curve \u2018Steepening\u2019? Here\u2019s Why That Matters: QuickTake The IMF meetings, held alongside the World Bank, mark the first time finance ministers and central bankers have gathered to discuss the outlook since the Federal Reserve\u2019s symposium in Jackson Hole in August put investors on notice that restrictive monetary policy might need to endure. Since then, oil-market gyrations and the Hamas attack on Israel have only served to cement the impression of a volatile backdrop, at a time when the global economy is still adjusting to the unprecedented pace of synchronized tightening of the past year. The challenge faced by policymakers assessing the fallout of multiple shocks in recent years, along with the as-yet unknown impact from rapidly jacked-up interest rates, was cited by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, who spoke alongside Gopinath. A collective assessment from the Group of 20 finance chiefs chimed with that view. Their communique stressed risks ranging from \u201cgeoeconomic tensions, extreme weather events, natural disasters and the tightening of global financial conditions which could worsen debt vulnerabilities.\u201d One of those threats is oil prices surging enough to stoke consumer prices again \u2014 a danger if the Israel-Hamas war ends up provoking a wider regional conflict. \u201cI\u2019m always worried about Iran, and how volatile that situation is, and its place in the global economy,\u201d said Harvard University Professor Jason Furman, a former White House adviser. \u201cCertainly we need to be more worried today than ever.\u201d Meanwhile, the evidence already suggests that inflation isn\u2019t yet fully tamed, a view ratified by the G-20 communique and witnessed in Thursday\u2019s brisk increase in US core prices. \u201cI do believe that overall, we see that interest rates will stay higher for longer,\u201d Deutsche Bank AG Chief Executive Office Christian Sewing told Francine Lacqua on Bloomberg TV. \u201cThat is something that our clients need to position for themselves.\u201d Sewing warned that the impact of higher borrowing costs on commercial real estate means that sector is in for a \u201cdifficult\u201d time for the next couple of years \u2014 a risk that regulators are monitoring too. Sovereign worries also featured at the Marrakech gathering. Earlier in the week, World Bank officials warned that higher-for-longer could yet have an impact in due course, not least because of the fallout on growth in lower-income countries. In a statement released on Saturday, Jubilee USA Network, a Washington-based non-profit group advocating financial relief for poor nations, criticized the sustained push to hike borrowing costs at a time when the IMF is forecasting weak growth, and inflation is easing. \u201cThe flawed policy of raising interest rates means that more developing countries face debt crisis,\u201d said Executive Director Eric LeCompte. \u201cMore than half of all countries are having trouble paying their debts and meeting the basic needs of their people.\u201d Regarding the overall outlook, there were still words of comfort on offer in Marrakech, notably from Gopinath, who observed that \u201cthe core\u201d of the financial system has held together, even if many wouldn\u2019t have predicted that with the extent to which rates have risen. Even so, her boss, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, warned that the threats to stability have multiple dimensions. \u201cClearly we are facing a higher-for-longer era,\u201d she said. \u201cA sharp further tightening of financial conditions could hit markets, banks and non-banks.\u201d --With assistance from Alexander Weber, Zoe Schneeweiss, Kamil Kowalcze, Steven Arons, Nicholas Comfort, Jana Randow and Scott Johnson (Economist).

        "text": " Richard Eisenberg retired in 2022. At 65, he stepped away from his job as managing editor for \"Next Avenue,\" the PBS website for people over 50, where he had worked for a decade. \"I had a rough idea of what my retirement would be,\" Eisenberg told Yahoo Finance. \"I knew I would be 'unretiring' since I still wanted to be doing some writing, some editing, and some teaching, but not all the time.\" So far, he has. Eisenberg, who lives in Westfield, N.J., explores \"unretirement\" in his expert columns, podcast and teaching posts, including an online NYU master class. \"I'm seeing a lot of curiosity about the idea,\" he said. \"I'm still a little surprised that it seems like such a foreign concept to people.\" A growing number of retirees like Eisenberg have stepped off the sidelines and headed back to work, especially after many were forced to retire in the pandemic, according to a new report from T. Rowe Price. Around 7% of retirees are looking for work in retirement, while 20% say they\u2019re already working part time or full time. \"In 2021, during the pandemic, that percentage was 10%,\" Judith Ward, a certified financial planner and thought leadership director at T. Rowe Price, told Yahoo Finance. \"They might have been forced to retire, and now we're seeing that they are reentering the workforce.\" Read more: How to find out your 2024 Social Security COLA increase The two main reasons for coming back into the workforce are a tale of opposites. While 45% chose to work for social and emotional benefits like Eisenberg, a slightly larger percentage \u2014 48% \u2014 felt they needed to work for financial reasons. Older adults, those age 65 and older, represent the fastest growing group of homeless, while poverty among older Americans has escalated. Policymakers and researchers have also been fretting that the share of older Americans with debt has risen from 38% to 63% since 1990, according to a recent report by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. \"Many people retired during the pandemic for a variety of reasons and the financial reality of that is now hitting home,\" Chris Farrell, author of \"Unretirement\" and \"Purpose and a Paycheck,\" told Yahoo Finance. \"Working even a few hours a week can help shore up household finances.\" \"They\u2019re taking advantage of the tight labor market to unretire, often by picking up part-time work, flexible gigs, starting their own business, and even encore careers,\" Farrell said. Damascus, Md.-based resident Gary Socha, 69, who retired after being laid off during the pandemic from his publishing job, stepped back in two years ago and is now working part time, four hours a day, as an advertising and event representative. \"It was too early, and my wife is five years younger and still working,\" Socha told Yahoo Finance. \"And financially... it just seems to make sense to make some more money and make yourself a little bit more secure and more comfortable for when you do retire. I could see doing this for quite a while.\" For other retirees, the lack of retirement planning or saving is coming back to haunt them. \"It's not uncommon for people to retire without having actually made a retirement plan, and then find some financial surprises along the way,\" Mark Miller, a retirement expert and author of \"Retirement Reboot,\" told Yahoo Finance. \"That can prompt some people to go back to work. And the faster pace of inflation we've been experiencing also is motivating some people to go back to work, just to help cover their living expenses.\" How much wealth you have to tap, of course, is the lynchpin. There\u2019s a huge difference by household assets when it comes to retirees who say they \"don\u2019t need to work,\" according to\u00a0the T. Rowe Price report, which surveyed 2,895 401(k) retirement plan participants and 1,136 retirees with a Rollover IRA or a left-in-plan balance. The report found 37% of retirees with household assets under $50,000 said they don\u2019t need to work versus 55% of those in the $50,000-to-$250,000 category and 72% with assets of $750,000 and above. Women are particularly vulnerable. In the report, 49% of retired women who were working or looking for work said they need the money compared to 41% of men. One reason is that many women have less savings to depend on in retirement and lower Social Security benefits because of time out of the workplace for caregiving. Learn more about top savings tools: 4 alternatives to savings accounts \"Typically, lower incomes, higher debt loads \u2014 especially student loans \u2014 and shorter job tenures are some of the factors contributing to the gender savings gap,\" Sudipto Banerjee, T. Rowe Price\u2019s vice president, retirement, and author of the report, told Yahoo Finance at the WISER Annual Women\u2019s Retirement Symposium. The biggest financial payoffs of additional years of paid work are pushing back retirement account withdrawals, continuing to save, and delaying claiming Social Security benefits. \"Additional income can give you more time to contribute to your savings and it can also help you pay down debt and increase your cash reserves ahead of full retirement,\" Ward said. And for those unretirees who haven\u2019t started taking their Social Security benefit, delaying to claim means more money down the road. \"You\u2019ll get a higher benefit, and it's inflation-adjusted, so that\u2019s a good deal for many people,\" Ward said. There\u2019s also the emotional draw of working, which is the second most-cited reason retirees choose to return to work. Many retirees see part-time work as a good transition strategy with 57% of retirees wanting to continue working in some form, the T. Rowe Price report found. Men, in particular, were more likely to cite social connections as motivation to work. \"A lot of us want to work part-time in retirement,\" Eisenberg said. \"We want to stay active, have social connections, bring in some income and to stay mentally engaged, but we also want to have time to do other things.\" Plus, there\u2019s the freedom to do what you want to do this time around, Eisenberg said. That means choosing a working route that isn\u2019t stuffed with meetings, administrative duties \u2014 all \"the parts of our former job that we didn't like so much.\" And then there are the psychological benefits that work can offer, Robert Laura, a retirement coach, told Yahoo Finance. Several studies have indicated the positive mental effects of working. In fact, among older adults, retirees are more likely to experience depression compared to those who are still working, according to one recent paper. \"Work provides routine, structure, connection, mental stimulus, purpose, and relevance,\" Laura said. \"These are all things that many people don't realize they are losing when they leave work and that aren't easily replaced with golf, grandkids, and crossword puzzles.\" Kerry Hannon is a Senior Reporter and Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

        "text": " Buying conditions may be tough, but homebuyers are coming to the table with bigger down payments. The US median down payment increased 11.3% year over year in the third quarter to $30,434, marking the highest total since Realtor.com started tracking the data in 2013. The average down payment percentage reached 14.71% of the purchase price in the same period, also the highest in the last decade. The trend suggests that homebuyers in today\u2019s market have the incentive and means to contribute large payments. They are leveraging their wealth \u2014 whether it is equity or cash \u2014 to beat out competitors without the same access. \"The people who are able to play ball in this interesting market are more likely to be higher earners,\" Hannah Jones, economic research analyst at Realtor.com, told Yahoo Finance. \"Also because inventory is so tight and mortgage rates are so high, it's creating a more competitive environment where people are more likely to put more down as a means of competition because there's such limited inventory on the market.\" Read more: Mortgage rates at 20-year high: Is 2023 a good time to buy a house? The median down payment amount grew 118% in the last four years to nearly $30,500 in the third quarter from $13,937 in the third quarter in 2019 before the pandemic began, according to Realtor.com\u2019s data. The surge can partly be attributed to rapidly rising home prices during the pandemic. The US median home price increased by nearly 40% to $373,253 in the third quarter from $266,861 in the same period in 2019. The average percentage of deposit as a share of home price also grew. Since 2013, the average annual share of down payment was 11.39%, but that number climbed after the start of COVID to 12.75% and hit 14.71% in the third quarter, suggesting buyers are starting their homeownership with more equity in hand. Today\u2019s homebuyers have good reasons to bump up their stake in their new homes. For starters, they want to beat out other offers by presenting themselves as less risky buyers. Read more: How to buy a house in 2023 \"When buyers get in multiple bids scenarios, it becomes a safer bet for sellers to pick a buyer who is able to put more down because it's an insurance policy about [the buyers\u2019] financial strength,\" Jones said. On top of that, buyers also want to reduce their monthly payment under today\u2019s high mortgage rates and a larger down payment can do that. For instance, a homebuyer purchasing a $300,000 home with a 10% down payment will have a monthly mortgage of about $1,900 with a 30-year mortgage at 7.57%. Under the same scenario but with a 15% down payment, the monthly payment would be reduced to $1,800. \"It makes a lot of sense that buyers are trying to limit the amount of interest on their loan,\" Jones said. A changing buyer pool is another reason for increasing down payments. Homebuyers who can come up with enough cash to purchase in today\u2019s market are not your traditional buyers. The majority of them are repeat buyers with carryover equity, higher-income households, or ones with access to large down payment. \"Buyers who are participating perhaps have a lot of money, they can put more down from a previous home sale,\" Jones said. \"Otherwise they are not so worried about the budget side of the equation.\" \"Almost like a biased sample,\" Jones said. On average, repeat buyers contributed 17% of the purchase price toward their down payment, whereas first-time buyers put down 6% on average, according to the National Association of Realtors\u2019 2022 Profile of Homebuyers and Sellers. While repeat buyers have always been the majority of the buyer pool, their share has grown to 75% in 2022 \u2014 or nearly three in four buyers. This is a significant growth compared to the historical average of 61.5% from 1981 to 2021. The number of first-time buyers has shrunk below historical averages, hitting 26% last year \u2014 an all-time low. In August, first-time buyers made up only 29% of all sales, well below the long-term average. Read more: First-time homebuyer in 2023: What you need to know Prospective buyers that intend to buy for the first time typically have lower incomes than repeat buyers (the median first-timer reports a household income of $75,000 to $79,999, versus $125,000 to $149,999 for prospective repeat buyers), according to Zillow\u2019s Consumer Housing Trends Report 2023. \"Today's market is so expensive and so challenging to compete in it,\" Jones said. The same report also shows that the higher the income, the higher the success rate of landing a home purchase. The percentage of successful homebuyers is 42% for households earning $100,000 or more, 27% for households earning $50,000 to $99,999, and 19% for families making less than $50,000. Some younger homebuyers also are getting a leg up by getting money from family or other loved ones. A recent LendingTree report found that 78% of Gen Z and 54% of millennial homeowners received some type of financial assistance for down payment. \"There's just no getting around how expensive houses are right now,\" Jacob Channel, LendingTree\u2019s senior economist and report author, told Yahoo Finance. \"And because of that there's more incentive for people to say to a parent or somebody like that, 'I'd really like to buy a house but it's so prohibitively expensive, I need some help.'\" These type of buyers are edging out potential first-time buyers who have limited means and a smaller down payment. The share of first-time buyers dropped to 29% in August from 30% a month ago. This is just 3 percentage points higher than November 2022\u2019s tracking at 26%, the lowest level recorded since NAR data collection began. \"We are not seeing that lower side of down payment because those buyers just can't play ball at all,\" Jones said.

        "text": " That chicken burrito with guacamole is soon going to cost a little extra, but that isn't likely to deter loyal Chipotle fans. After announcing a pause earlier this year, the global burrito chain plans to raise prices again for the fourth time in two years. Its chief corporate affairs officer Laurie Schalow said in a statement to Yahoo Finance that the company is making the increase to offset inflation. While the company hasn't said when or how much prices will increase, many on the street speculate it will be roughly a 3-3.5% increase in the middle of Q4, when an updated menu typically comes out. This comes as commodity prices are sticky, with \"ongoing pressure\" around the price of avocados, beef and chicken, CITI Analyst Jon Tower said on a phone call with Yahoo Finance. He said another factor could be to get ahead of California's Fast Food Accountability and Standards Recovery Act, known as the FAST Act, which moves minimum wage up to $20, effective April 1, 2024. Though the move may put a sour taste in consumers' mouth, they'll still show up. \"A $13 burrito at Chipotle is more appealing in this environment than an $18 salad for instance at Sweetgreen,\" TD Cowen Analyst Andrew Charles said to Yahoo Finance over the phone. \"[Chipotle's] value perceptions are outpacing its peers,\" he said, which include Panera, Shake Shack (SHAK), Cava (CAVA), Starbucks (SBUX) and Sweetgreen (SG). As consumers opt for quick service instead of casual restaurants due to inflation and tighter wallets, Chipotle is poised to gain additional market share, similar to what it did in 2008-2009. And while price is a factor, convenience also plays a role, according to Tower. The company is investing in digital capabilities like mobile orders and its drive-thru concept Chipotlanes. Upping its digital capabilities will also enable the company to get more customer data. During Q2, digital sales made up 38% of Chipotle's total food and beverage revenue. Of the 47 new restaurants it opened, 40 locations included a Chipotlane. This year, the company plans to open 255 to 285 new restaurants, and 10-15 existing locations will add a Chipotlane, which Charles said tend to have a higher digital and sales mix, calling it a \"win-win-win.\" In the past month, shares of Chipotle are down nearly 8% as it closed at $1,781.48 on Friday. In the last five years, its shares are up more than 300%. Tower, who has a buy rating, recently lowered his price target to $2,260 from $2,391. Both the S&P 500 and restaurant foot traffic were flying high in the summer, but they have since moderated, he said. In September and early October, foot traffic at Chipotles increased, but at a lower rate, according to Citi Research, which cites data from Placer.ai. For example, during the week ending July 16, foot traffic jumped 12.3% compared to a year ago, but in the last week of September that increase was 3.9%. Though Chipotle trades at a premium compared to its peers, Tower said the current price is still a very attractive entry point, given the company's history of gaining additional market share. The company has also been investing in expansion. In North America, it has set a long term target of 7,000 restaurants. As of the end of Q2, there are more than 3,200. In July, Chipotle announced its first-ever development agreement to open locations in the Middle East and accelerate its international efforts early next year.\u00a0 The \"long-term possibilities\" are there, Tower said, especially when it comes to new stores. It is on the \"precipice\" of expanding its presence, which will create increasing value over time. Throughput \u2014 how fast a Chipotle store can get customers in and out of stores \u2014 should improve with new technology in the works like Chippy and Autocado. A robot food assembly line could also unlock value. And the expansion of Chipotlanes could open up the restaurants to fulfill additional demands or create new features. A pivot to offering a breakfast menu is a possibility, said Tower. Imagine that: breakfast burritos, tacos, bowls... maybe even avocado toast. \u2014 Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Zambia was the first African country to default on its debt in the pandemic era and its restructuring process saw it agree broad terms to rework the debt with official creditors including China and members of the Paris Club of creditor nations in June. \"Each official creditor will now begin their internal process to sign the MoU. Following the signing of the MoU, the terms will be implemented through bilateral agreements with each member of the OCC (Official Creditor Committee),\" a ministry statement said. The agreements will include an average extension of debt maturities of more than 12 years, with interest rates set at 1% during the next 14 years and up to 2.5% after that. There is a mechanism to increase payments if Zambia's economy performs better than expected. Zambia will pay about $750 million in the next decade compared to almost $6 billion that was due to official creditors before the debt restructuring. \"The next step is to secure a comparable agreement with our private creditors,\" Zambia's finance minister, Situmbeko Musokotwane, said. Zambia is committed to remaining in arrears to its commercial external creditors, the ministry said, until it secures a debt deal with comparable terms to the official creditor agreement. The copper producer's commercial creditors include international bondholders, who are owed more than $3 billion. The country is currently in formal talks with a bondholder creditor committee to restructure more than $3 billion of overseas bonds. The discussions kicked off earlier in October , so for now the creditors are restricted from trading the country's notes. Zambia has three outstanding dollar bonds maturing in 2022, 2024 and 2027 , currently trading at 52-58 cents on the dollar. It is unclear how long the signing of the agreements between Zambia and each bilateral creditor is going to take. \"We are grateful to all our official creditors, especially the co-chairs of the committee, China and France, and vice-chair South Africa, for their commitment to help resolve Zambia's debt overhang,\" Musokotwane said. On Thursday, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said Zambia had signed the MoU with official creditors, which was later walked back by Zambia's finance minister and the IMF.

        "text": " Wall Street\u2019s great debate of 2023 \u2014 whether the US economy is headed for a recession \u2014 is resurfacing amid escalating unrest in the Middle East. Heightened geopolitical risk, along with unabating inflationary pressures, surging bond yields, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s \"higher for longer\" vision, has business leaders bracing for a contraction. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fog on the horizon,\u201d KPMG US CEO Paul Knopp told Yahoo Finance Live, citing geopolitical tensions as one of the top risks to the economy. Seventy-two percent of CEOs are preparing for a US recession over the next 12-18 months, according to The Conference Board\u2019s survey of business leaders. While that\u2019s an improvement from the start of the year, expectations about the short-term economic outlook have darkened. Big bank CEOs are among those weighing in on a more uncertain economic outlook. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon pointed to a number of potential risks, including a sober warning on geopolitical crises abroad. Citigroup (C) CEO Jane Fraser noted \u201can increasingly cautious consumer\u201d in the bank\u2019s earnings release Friday. Fraser\u2019s note of cracks beginning to form in consumer spending is something that\u2019s been highlighted recently. Constellation Brands (STZ) CEO Bill Newlands told Yahoo Finance Live this week that shoppers are already \"spending a little less\" while being more \"careful\" about what they buy. The reason this is problematic is because the resilient consumer has helped the US economy defy recession predictions so far this year, as consumer spending accounts for nearly 70% of US GDP. And if you look at the recent sentiment data, it\u2019s not too encouraging. Consumer sentiment plunged in October to its lowest level in five months, driven in large part by households expecting higher inflation next year. And sticky inflation is not just an issue for consumers, but for the Fed too. The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed prices held steady at 3.7% in September, well above the Fed's goal of 2%. \u201cWith the Fed committed to returning inflation back to its long-run target of 2%, this would raise the odds of rate increases this year, extend the duration of restrictive monetary policy, and increase the chances of a recession occurring down the road,\u201d Oxford Economics lead US economist Michael Pearce wrote in a note to clients this week. To sum it up: The probability of a recession is still anyone\u2019s guess, but it\u2019s safe to say the economic outlook remains murky. Sofi\u2019s (SOFI) Head of Investment Strategy Liz Young put it perfectly: \u201cWe are not out of the woods just yet,\u201d she told Yahoo Finance. \u201cIt could still get worse before it gets better.\u201d Seana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "text": " (Bloomberg) -- New Zealand opposition leader Christopher Luxon said he will form a new government of the center-right after defeating Prime Minister Chris Hipkins\u2019 Labour Party in Saturday\u2019s election. Most Read from Bloomberg Israel Latest: Army Says Over 600,000 Gazans Have Fled South US Pushes Bid to Avert Wider Israel War After Iran Warning Israel Latest: Biden and Abbas Talk as Gaza Invasion Nears Your Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas War Global Markets Stable as US Pushes to Contain Middle East War Luxon\u2019s National Party \u201cwill be in a position to lead the next government,\u201d he told party faithful in Auckland. \u201cMy pledge to you is that our government will deliver for every New Zealander.\u201d With 97% of votes tallied, National had 39% while Labour trailed on 27%. As the result stands, National can form a government with the support of its ally the libertarian ACT Party, on 9%. However, they may yet need the backing of the nationalist New Zealand First Party, on 6%, to reach a majority in parliament. Labour and its partners on the left, the Green Party and Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori, have no path to power. Labour\u2019s support has collapsed from 50% at the 2020 election, when Jacinda Ardern led the party to the first outright majority since New Zealand switched to a proportional representation system in 1996. Hipkins, who took over when Ardern suddenly stepped down in January this year, has struggled to convince New Zealanders that Labour deserves a third term as the economy stutters amid a cost-of-living crisis. \u201cI did know when I took on this job that it was going to be an uphill battle,\u201d Hipkins told supporters. \u201cNo government has replaced a prime minister in an election year and carried on to win. I gave it my all to turn the tide of history, but alas, that was not enough.\u201d National\u2019s win means Luxon, the former chief executive of Air New Zealand who only entered politics three years ago, will become New Zealand\u2019s next prime minister. He will now enter talks with ACT leader David Seymour and, if required, New Zealand First leader Winston Peters to agree on a governing arrangement. The electoral system lends itself to coalition governments, and talks between the winning parties can take several weeks. Peters Returns The election sees the return of Peters, the 78-year-old Lazarus of New Zealand politics, who has made the third political comeback of his 44-year career after his party was ousted from parliament at the last election. If his support is needed for a government to be formed, he can be expected to extract policy concessions and ministerial posts in return. The cost of living dominated the election campaign, with both National and Labour promising measures to ease pressure on household budgets. But neither of the two major party leaders electrified voters the way Ardern did at the last two elections. The new government faces a challenging economic outlook, with the central bank forecasting a recession as it keeps interest rates high to bring inflation under control. National has promised tax cuts partially funded by removing a ban on the sale of expensive homes to foreigners and collecting a levy on each transaction. It also plans to strip the Reserve Bank of its dual mandate and return it to a sole focus on fighting inflation. Luxon said his government \u201cwill rebuild the economy and deliver tax relief.\u201d \u201cWe will bring down the cost of living, we will restore law and order,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will deliver better healthcare and we will educate our children so that they can grow up and live the lives that they dream of.\u201d Another feature of the provisional results is increased support for Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori \u2014 the party that stands for the rights of the indigenous M\u0101ori people \u2014 which is on track to win four of seven seats reserved for voters on the M\u0101ori roll. Those seats have traditionally been held by Labour. If Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori wins more seats than its 2.6% share of the party vote implies, it would create a so-called overhang and increase the size of parliament from 120 seats. That would raise the number of seats required for a majority and may see Peters\u2019 support needed for a government to be formed.

        "text": " (Bloomberg) -- Igor Sechin, the boss of Russia\u2019s state oil company and longtime associate of Vladimir Putin, celebrated New Year\u2019s Eve on a yacht anchored off Palm Jumeirah, the man-made Dubai island dotted with oligarch-friendly beachfront villas. Most Read from Bloomberg Israel Latest: Army Says Over 600,000 Gazans Have Fled South US Pushes Bid to Avert Wider Israel War After Iran Warning Israel Latest: Biden and Abbas Talk as Gaza Invasion Nears Your Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas War Global Markets Stable as US Pushes to Contain Middle East War Sechin spent most of 2022 grappling with the impact of the invasion of Ukraine on Russia\u2019s oil exports and finding new customers in the wake of sanctions. His most important guest that night was one of the men who helped him do it: oil trader Murtaza Lakhani, according to four people with direct knowledge of the matter. A veteran of crude oil deals from Baghdad to Caracas, the Karachi native made a name for himself navigating some of the most challenging jurisdictions. Now, in alliance with Sechin, he\u2019d helped set up a web of oil traders and shipping firms to steer Russian barrels around the globe amid a nuanced response from the West \u2014 sanctions and a price cap intended to restrict revenues alongside prodding from Washington to keep the flow going. This story is based on interviews with several dozen people familiar with Lakhani\u2019s business empire and the Russian oil trade, including people who\u2019ve recently worked for his companies. They didn\u2019t want to be identified discussing confidential business dealings. Most of Lakhani\u2019s Russia-related operations take place in countries not implementing the G-7\u2019s price cap on exports, designed to block oil sold above $60 from critical Western-provided services such as shipping insurance. Having worked with Rosneft PJSC for nearly a decade before the invasion, he was also in a good position to help the state oil giant navigate an increasingly complex sanctions regime. Although Lakhani\u2019s main trading firm, Mercantile & Maritime Group, has done deals with Rosneft in the past, the network formed in the wake of the war in Ukraine relies on recently created companies, many of them in the United Arab Emirates, according to six people with direct knowledge of the matter and the internal assessment of a leading Western intelligence agency seen by Bloomberg News. The people said that even if he doesn\u2019t own them on paper, Lakhani was involved in setting up the firms and plays a role directing their activities. Prominent among them are Tejarinaft FZCO, Fossil Trading FZCO and Amur II - FZCO, according to the people. The law firm Schillings, which represents Lakhani, said he has no involvement in any of those companies. Those firms, which appear in invoice data over the past year as some of the biggest traders of Russian oil, have bought tens of millions of barrels of the country\u2019s crude, loaded them onto ships and sold them to customers in India and China. It\u2019s helped Moscow minimize the impact of sanctions and earned a big windfall for both Rosneft, which pays billions in dividends to the Kremlin, and Lakhani, four of the people said. Until now, the White House has prioritized preventing a surge in crude prices rather than penalizing every actor involved in sidestepping the Russian oil restrictions, according to five US officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. More recently, that thinking has shifted, though, as data suggests much more of the trade happening above the cap, the people said. Through his lawyers, Lakhani said neither he nor any business in which he has an interest is trading Russian oil or oil products. His companies stopped trading or shipping Russian oil in accordance with all applicable sanctions, his lawyers wrote in a letter. Rosneft and Sechin didn\u2019t respond to written requests for comment. \u201cBefore the war, Rosneft had links with a number of traders in Europe,\u201d said Agathe Duparc, a Geneva-based researcher at Swiss non-governmental organization Public Eye, who closely follows the commodities industry and spoke in general terms. \u201cThese days, it\u2019s mostly smaller firms controlled by a few individual traders working with the Kremlin. They change their names and set up in Dubai, making their deals more opaque than ever before.\u201d Sechin Relationship Born in Karachi in 1962 but raised in England and Canada, Lakhani catapulted himself into the upper echelon of the commodities trading world with a risky bet several decades ago. After the first Gulf War he called himself Glencore\u2019s \u201cman in Baghdad.\u201d At the time, Iraq could only sell its crude via a system known as the oil-for-food program, administered by the United Nations. Saddam Hussein found a workaround \u2014 later revealed in a UN probe. Lakhani\u2019s role was to move bags of cash for the trading firm, dropping them off at the Iraqi diplomatic mission in Geneva, according to the UN report. READ: Billion Dollar Broker: How One Man Managed a Nation\u2019s Oil Wealth That investigation, which never alleged any wrongdoing on Lakhani\u2019s part, acquainted him with a slew of officials in Washington. He\u2019d later build that network out \u2014 bringing on grandees to the boards of his firms, including Simon Murray, the former Glencore chairman, and Charles Guthrie, who\u2019d been the most senior general in the British army. Lakhani also became a major donor to the UK\u2019s Conservative Party, records from the Electoral Commission show. Then, not long after Sechin\u2019s appointment as Rosneft CEO in 2012, the Russian oil boss got in touch with Lakhani, according to four people familiar with the matter. A former Soviet interpreter and intelligence operative, Sechin served as Putin\u2019s chief of staff at the Saint Petersburg mayor\u2019s office in the 1990s and later rose to deputy prime minister. The Russian official forged a close bond with Lakhani after the trader helped Rosneft expand into Iraq, four of the people said, and he was soon advising the firm on a range of issues. Lakhani\u2019s word began to carry such weight that Rosneft employees were regularly told to turn to him for guidance rather than handle a transaction in house, according to two of the people and emails seen by Bloomberg. The trader then appointed Daniel Richard, a lawyer who served on Rosneft Trading\u2019s board, to the board of his flagship firm Mercantile & Maritime, which he founded in 2014. (He\u2019 s since stepped down.) A Glencore spokesperson declined to comment. Murray, Guthrie and the UK Conservative Party didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Richard confirmed his former board role but declined to comment further. \u2018Extensive\u2019 Network Lakhani\u2019s Russia relationship only deepened with time, according to M&M\u2019s financial filings and its own public statements. A 2021 advertisement that he bought in The Energy Year noted how M&M\u2019s \u201cextensive and high-end trading network is key to its success \u2013 boosted by collaborative relations with key players such as Rosneft, ExxonMobil, TotalEnergies, Shell, Repsol, BP and MOL.\u201d The firm said in the advert it was the biggest shipper of the Russian state oil giant\u2019s seaborne oil-product exports in 2020. Spokespeople for Exxon, Total, Repsol and MOL didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. A representative at Shell said it doesn\u2019t have a relationship with M&M. A BP spokesperson said it\u2019s never traded with Lakhani or his companies. After Bloomberg\u2019s requests for comment, the old advert removed references to every company except Rosneft, the archival Wayback Machine website shows. Big Russia Presence in India Energy Summit Signals Stronger Ties While his Russia business flourished in the years before the Ukraine invasion, Lakhani also burnished his contacts in Washington and London. After jetting into countries navigating sanctions, such as Venezuela, he made a habit of updating US and UK officials on his discussions, six people familiar with the matter said. As a result, colleagues and confidants said Lakhani remained confident that he could earn significant profits from his businesses in these jurisdictions while avoiding the blow-back of sanctions. Lakhani\u2019s role behind the scenes became even more relevant this year as White House and US Treasury officials urged trading heavyweights in private meetings to keep Russian oil flows going in an effort to avert a supply shock that could prompt a surge in prices at the pump, people with direct knowledge of the matter said. Lakhani and Sechin have grown even closer in the past year, following an exodus of senior Rosneft staff, including Didier Casimiro, Eric Liron and Zeljko Runje, four of the people said. Lakhani\u2019s network also includes Emirati bankers as well as Indian refiners, Lebanese traders and Russian lawyers, who\u2019ve helped Rosneft forge an alternative payment method that largely bypasses the US dollar, some of the people said. Meantime, Azeri, Greek and UAE shipping interests have been tapped to move Rosneft\u2019s crude, they said. The state oil giant accounts for nearly half of the output in the world\u2019s No. 2 crude exporting nation, giving the company a particularly significant role in global flows. READ: Dubai Becomes New Switzerland for Traders of Russian Commodities Lakhani\u2019s network of firms trading Russian oil is centered on the UAE, according to people familiar with the matter. One of them, Fossil Trading, has a direct link to Rosneft: It also owns Energopole SA, according to Energopole\u2019s website. The Swiss trading unit had been set up by Rosneft following the imposition of US sanctions in 2020 on Rosneft Trading SA. It became part of Fossil in 2022. Other firms in the network trade large volumes of the state oil giant\u2019s cargoes, according to detailed trade and shipping data compiled by KSE Institute, a part of the Kyiv School of Economics. Amur handled 120,000 barrels per day of Russian crude in the first half of 2023 while Tejarinaft took 55,000 barrels per day in that period, ranking fifth and eighth overall, excluding the trading units of Russian producers, the trade and shipping data show. Key Lakhani associates have been involved. One is Edward Ghazal, a Lebanese oil trader who worked for two years at Lakhani\u2019s M&M in Singapore before becoming a founding director at Tejarinaft in April 2022, according to documents seen by Bloomberg. A second is Hicham Fizazi, a Moroccan national, who helped Lakhani incorporate multiple firms, some of the people said. He appears in UAE corporate records as a director at both Tejarinaft as well as multiple Amur entities in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Ghazal declined to comment, while Fossil Trading, Energopole, Amur, Tejarinaft, and Fizazi didn\u2019t respond to emails and LinkedIn messages seeking comment. Officials at Dubai Silicon Oasis, the free-trade zone where Fossil Trading, Amur and Tejarinaft are registered, also didn\u2019t return calls and emails seeking comment. Formed in September 2022, Amur Investments Limited sits on the 12th floor of Al Sila Tower in Abu Dhabi Global Market, the emirate\u2019s international financial center. Its listed shareholder is Dubai-based Amur II FZCO, an offshore crude oil trading firm, which opened a month earlier, according to Emirati corporate records. On a recent Friday afternoon, Amur\u2019s ADGM office was humming. Just around the corner, an office assistant pointed out an empty desk for a firm that she said was run by the same man. The recently formed special purpose vehicle, called Invest Co Holdings Limited, appears in ADGM records with just one shareholder, director and secretary: Lakhani. On Oct. 3, Lakhani also set up a new firm in the same tower called Mercantile & Maritime Terminals Ltd., ADGM records show. Hamad Al Mazrouei, CEO of the ADGM Registration Authority, said the financial center requires its firms to comply fully with all applicable rules and that it keeps close watch of global regulatory developments, including applicable sanctions. In response to questions posed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a UAE official said the Gulf state is fully aware of its responsibilities in protecting the integrity of the global financial system. M&M Operations M&M said it stopped trading Russian-origin oil products in February, according to company filings, and that chief financial officer Sergey Geller, who was previously its head of Russia, resigned as director at the end of July. That coincides with a big increase in trade by the newer Middle Eastern and Asian entities that people familiar with the matter say are linked to Lakhani. Geller didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. People familiar with the trader\u2019s travel say he\u2019s constantly on the go. His luxury real estate portfolio spans Europe, the Middle East and North America. In the UK, he prefers to fly private through airports northwest of London. Until last year, he held a controlling interest in his own yacht broker firm Yachting Partners International Limited, UK corporate records show. In a given week, Lakhani will meet the leadership in Somalia to ensure the safe passage of crude through the Gulf of Aden, dine at some of London\u2019s most exclusive social clubs and then huddle with Sechin in Moscow to discuss business, three of the people said. While part of the billionaire\u2019s support staff still works from London, he\u2019s spending more time in the Persian Gulf these days to build out operations from Dubai to Manama, the people said. READ: Oil Trader Lakhani Buys Fuel Storage Terminal at UAE\u2019s Fujairah European sanctions have made it riskier for firms involved in the Russia trade to operate from the UK and Rosneft has also demanded greater discretion for intermediaries involved with shipments. He recently moved some operations away from his long-time office around the corner from the Saatchi Gallery in London\u2019s upmarket Chelsea neighborhood, according to UK corporate records. Lakhani had told people involved in the deal that the country was no longer a suitable jurisdiction for his trading operations. Washington\u2019s Strategy Back in Washington, Biden officials say they\u2019re confident the price cap has mostly been successful \u2014 maintaining market stability while reducing oil revenues that trickle back to Moscow \u2014 but now is a chance to tighten the screws on some traders skirting the rules. \u201cCoalition compliance and enforcement authorities take allegations of intentional price cap violations extremely seriously and will exercise appropriate authorities to take action where appropriate,\u201d Eric Van Nostrand, US Treasury\u2019s acting Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy, wrote in response to questions. Four US officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that Washington has benefited from market intelligence provided by commodity traders active in Russia, with some of the information proving more accurate than the government\u2019s own internal forecasts. But Lakhani\u2019s ongoing relationship with Sechin, who has been under sanctions since 2014, has prompted concerns from some officials pushing for a maximum pressure strategy by Washington, London and Brussels, according to three of the people. Meantime, the recent oil rally has presented a conundrum for both policy makers and the intermediaries involved in the Russian trade. With most barrels of the nation\u2019s flagship Urals selling above the $60 cap, the question is how aggressively might Washington crack down on non-compliance, just as tensions in the Middle East also risk sending crude prices higher, four of the people said. In recent weeks, Lakhani has privately voiced his desire to forge ahead with the Russian oil trade, three of the people said. He\u2019s told some colleagues that the recent market disruptions mark an opportunity to turn his organization into an industry leader, the people said. --With assistance from Chanyaporn Chanjaroen, Stephanie Baker, Anthony Di Paola, Hemal Savai, Laura Hurst, Francois de Beaupuy, Thomas Gualtieri and Veronika Gulyas.

        "text": " By Sharon Bernstein SACRAMENTO, Calif., Oct 14 (Reuters) - Jewish and Palestinian Muslim communities in the United States remain on edge a week after the brutal attack by Hamas militants on Israeli civilians and Israel's subsequent reprisals in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. Friday services, highlighted by the main weekly prayers for Muslims and the start of the Jewish Sabbath at sundown, were the first since the massacre. Mosques and synagogues beefed up security as tension ran high in both communities. As people gathered in grief and worry, synagogues invited trauma experts to speak to congregants shaken by the unexpected attacks and war in the Middle East, said Richard Priem, a security expert who works with Jewish organizations. \"This is a Shabbos when we all need to come together as one big family that suffered a tremendous, horrific loss,\" said Rabbi Motti Seligson, a spokesman for the Chabad movement of Hasidic Jews, using the Yiddish word for the Jewish Sabbath. Larry Mead, vice president of the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles, said, \"We are seeing the Jewish community is very apprehensive. \"They feel upset and they feel helpless. They are on edge.\" Synagogues expected turnout on Friday night to be higher than usual as worshippers sought spiritual and emotional connection. \"We're not going to cancel Shabbat,\" said Rabbi Joseph Potasnik, executive vice president of the New York Board of Rabbis. \"We're not going to cancel Jewish life.\" In Brooklyn Heights, the Orthodox Congregation B'nai Avraham and Chabad planned a Sabbath dinner for 120 people to pray in spiritual solidarity, Rabbi Aaron Raskin said. Also in Brooklyn, Reform Congregation Beth Elohim planned programs over the weekend for children and teens. \"Many of us know someone or love someone who was killed, is in captivity, was hiding in terror, or is being called up for service,\" the synagogue told congregants in an email. \"And meanwhile, hundreds of innocent Palestinians are also losing their lives, trapped in Gaza as the war is just beginning.\" In California, social worker Diane Weber prepared to speak to Congregation Beth Shalom in suburban Sacramento about trauma, survival and community. \"What I'm hearing is the need for a safe place just to talk and for gathering for support,\" Weber said. It was key to remind people of the little things they can do at times of fear and trauma, such as being aware of the sights and smells around them when doing something as ordinary as washing the dishes, she said. In the Natomas neighborhood across town, Muslim worshippers at the Tarbiya Institute held special prayers for those who had lost loved ones, and heard a sermon on how to respond spiritually to conflict and trauma. Among those attending was Basim Elkarra, executive director of the Sacramento chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). Elkarra, who condemned the attacks on civilians by Hamas, also carries the burden of knowing that his own relatives have been killed. The night before, he said, 17 members of his brother-in-law's family were killed as they tried to evacuate northern Gaza in advance of Israeli attacks. The day before that, three relatives were killed in strikes in Gaza. \"It\u2019s just horrendous,\" he said. \"You feel this guilt that we are living here in freedom, and our family over there is suffering.\" Elkarra said he took hope from calls he had been receiving from Jewish colleagues in the region's interfaith community. Ahmed Rehab, executive director of the Chicago CAIR chapter, said on Facebook he had also been talking with Jewish counterparts in the region, and took hope in the connections made. A Chicago rabbi reached out to him this week, Rehab posted, after the two hashed through some difficult discussions a few weeks ago. In the post, Rehab recounted what the rabbi told him: \"There is a lot of hurt in my community, but I am calling today to let you know I am thinking about the hurt in yours, and to express my sympathies to anyone who has lost a loved one.\" (Reporting by Sharon Bernstein; Editing by Donna Bryson and Clarence Fernandez)"

In an interview, the National Bank of Slovakia chief said officials will stay alert to consumer-price risks even if no more increases in borrowing costs are currently envisaged. It\u2019s equally premature to accelerate the wind-down of the ECB\u2019s balance-sheet while they see that policy through, he added. \u201cOur focus is now on maintaining rates at a plateau,\u201d Kazimir said, speaking in the Moroccan city of Marrakech, where he\u2019s attending meetings of the International Monetary Fund. \u201cIt could be a year before we\u2019ll consider cuts.\u201d The ECB raised rates for a 10th consecutive time last month and said that, barring any surprises, it will keep them at current levels for a \u201csufficiently long\u201d time to ensure inflation returns soon enough to 2%. While economists and financial markets were skeptical at first that policymakers would carry that out, they\u2019re now starting to sign on to the idea. That\u2019s partly driven by concerns that wage growth in the 20-nation euro zone hasn\u2019t yet peaked. Such concerns prompted several of Kazimir\u2019s colleagues to argue in interviews this week that speeding up quantitative tightening by ending reinvestments in the ECB\u2019s pandemic-era bond portfolio would be a logical next step to tightening. The Slovakian says that shouldn\u2019t be rushed. \u201cI don\u2019t expect changes to PEPP before the summer,\u201d he said. \u201cWe first have to be sure to be done with rate hikes. The logic order of our toolbox is important.\u201d Similarly, Kazimir is unconvinced for now about withdrawing significant amounts of liquidity from financial markets by raising minimum reserve requirements \u2014 currently set at 1% of certain assets on banks\u2019 balance sheet. \u201cGoing back to 2% on reserve requirements would be OK for me, but I wouldn\u2019t want to do more at the moment,\u201d he added \u201cWe need to be careful not to cause additional volatility in markets.\u201d Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek The K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTS Introducing The Businessweek Show With Max Abelson Has Bob Iger Lost the Magic?

        "text": " KYIV, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Fighting along the northern portion of Ukraine's eastern front has \"significantly worsened\" in recent days, the commander of Kyiv's ground forces said on Saturday. Oleksandr Syrskyi, who was visiting Ukrainian troops in the area, said Russian forces had regrouped after suffering losses and were attacking around the village of Makiivka and towards the city of Kupiansk. \"The main objective of the enemy is the defeat of a grouping of our troops, the encirclement of Kupiansk and to reach the Oskil River,\" he said in comments carried by an official military platform. Syrskyi added that Russian forces were carrying out \"dozens\" of assaults each day, but that Ukrainian troops had been ready and were holding their ground. The development comes as Kremlin forces were also pummelling the strategic Ukrainian city of Avdiivka, on a different section of the eastern front, in what Russian and Western officials said amounted to a new offensive. A four-month-old Ukrainian counteroffensive has made some progress in both the east, near Bakhmut, and in the south, where Kyiv hopes to reach the Sea of Azov, but gains have been incremental.

        "text": " (Bloomberg) -- Australia has voted overwhelmingly against including First Nations people in the country\u2019s constitution, rejecting a proposal to set up an Indigenous advisory body to Parliament.

Australian Broadcasting Corp. projected on Saturday that the referendum was headed for a clear defeat. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he respected the will of the Australian people and sought to cast an optimistic vision ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s now up to all of us to come together and find a different way to the same reconciled destination,\u201d he said. \u201cThe historic fact that Australia\u2019s story is 65,000 years old remains a source of national pride,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom tomorrow, we will continue to write the next chapter in that great Australian story, and we will write it together. And reconciliation must be a part of that chapter.\u201d In addition to a national majority, changes to Australia\u2019s constitution also require the support of at least four of the country\u2019s six states \u2014 a so-called double-majority. As of Saturday night, New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania and South Australia are projected to have voted against the Voice to Parliament. Counting is still going on in Western Australia, with the \u201cno\u201d vote well ahead there too. The result will be a setback to reconciliation efforts with Indigenous Australians and a political blow to the center-left Labor government that\u2019s been in office less than 18 months. Albanese had hoped the ballot would bring Australians together in a moment of unity, instead it has exposed division and raised allegations of racism. Albanese had initiated the referendum to give greater representation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders under a proposal put forward by Indigenous elders in 2017. But polls ahead of the vote had shown widespread opposition to the Voice to Parliament, with Australians concerned it would divide the country by race and many left unclear on how the body would operate. \u201cIt\u2019s not the Australian people\u2019s fault,\u201d Thomas Mayo, a spokesperson for the \u2018yes\u2019 campaign, said in an interview on ABC television. \u201cIt\u2019s the people that have lied to us, to the Australian people, they are the ones that we should be blaming.\u201d The referendum\u2019s failure will damage Albanese politically and hurt him personally, with the prime minister having regularly shown emotion while campaigning for the amendment. \u201cThis is the referendum that Australia did not need to have,\u201d opposition center-right Liberal leader Peter Dutton said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen tonight is Australians literally in their millions reject the prime minister\u2019s divisive referendum.\u201d The result adds to the long history of failed referendums in Australia since Federation in 1901, with just eight of now 45 efforts having succeeded.

Huddled in the playground because the building was full, he struggled to separate rumor from reality. Phone lines were patchy, the power was out and air strikes were thundering all around. In any case, the 31-year-old had two adult brothers with cerebral palsy to consider. The family had left their home with a few bags after a previous evacuation call and didn\u2019t know where else to go. He decided to stay put. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous to move south. It\u2019s too far,\u201d he said by telephone, voice listless, before the connection dropped. The United Nations said Friday the Israeli military had told its staff on the ground that all residents of northern Gaza \u2014 roughly half the territory\u2019s population of over 2 million \u2014 had until midnight to relocate south. It called the task \u201cimpossible.\u201d Israel\u2019s military spokesman Jonathan Conricus said early Saturday that it had observed a \u201csignificant movement of Palestinians toward the south\u201d following the warning. Read more coverage of the conflict on the Terminal and online. A 140-square-mile sliver of land on the Mediterranean, Gaza is ruled by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, but its borders are controlled by Egypt and Israel, which has declared a full siege, cutting off electricity and water. Crossings used to transport food are closed and discussions for a humanitarian corridor through Egypt have yet to bear fruit.

Bombarded by thousands of Israeli aerial strikes since Hamas mounted its unprecedented attack on Israel nearly a week ago, more than 270,000 Palestinians had, like Dawoud, sought shelter in about 90 schools run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. With nearly a dozen mosques already destroyed, others had fled to hospitals and churches, or joined relatives living near the main UN compound in Gaza City, calculating it would be spared. UNRWA, which serves Palestinian refugees, said 13 of its employees had been killed as of Friday. It\u2019s moved its international staff and central operations from Gaza City further south and urged Israel not to strike its facilities.

As images emerged of children and elderly people being snatched from the streets, Israel formed a war cabinet to uproot the armed group altogether. It\u2019s amassed 300,000 reservists, ready for a widely-expected ground offensive. More than 2,000 Palestinians were killed when Israel last invaded Gaza in 2014.

The group, which has governed the enclave for 16 years, often operates out of heavily-populated areas, making it virtually impossible to avoid civilian casualties, even with a 24-hour warning. Reduced to Sand Yousef Hammash, an advocacy officer at the Norwegian Refugee Council and a documentary-maker based in Gaza, said hundreds of families had rushed to the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem compound which includes a church, convent and school, as well as the Arab Orthodox Social and Cultural Center. He fled himself to stay with relatives in the comparatively well-to-do Rimal neighborhood where the UN has its headquarters. But entire blocks of Rimal, Arabic for \u2018sands\u2019, have already been destroyed. \u201cSections of Rimal have been reduced to sand,\u201d said Hammash. \u201cPeople are literally running for their lives.\u201d In the chaos, the Al-Shifa medical complex has emerged as a magnet for those who\u2019ve found schools and churches too full to accommodate them. Nowhere to Go Ghassan Abu Habel said he initially fled from his home to his in-laws\u2019 house in Al-Karama, north of Gaza City, thinking it would be safer. \u201cBut a rocket fell just outside the house; it was a phosphorus bomb. We extinguished the flames with sand. Then another artillery shell. We rushed inside the house as F-16 air strikes rocked the area, shattering windows and causing shrapnel injuries to my face,\u201d he said, adding that he had 20 stitches. Huddled with his wife, children, and in-laws, about 20 people in total, in the pitch-black house, they finally resolved to flee. However, it was still dark outside, and rockets continued to rain down. His wheelchair-bound father-in-law and elderly mother-in-law slowed their progress through a hellscape of rubble. They sought refuge in a neighbor\u2019s house, resigned to perish together before ambulances arrived to rescue them from this \u201cnightmare.\u201d The UN-run schools were already full, so the ambulances proceeded to a small pediatric hospital, only to find it already overflowing. The Hospital Finally, the ambulances deposited the family at Al-Shifa Hospital, where hundreds of displaced people had already filled the premises, camping in the carpark and staking out patches of hallways and wards. Men loitered helplessly in the hospital\u2019s grounds as incoming ambulances blared their sirens and the sound of explosions reverberated in the background. Inside the hospital, women and children filled corridor floors as doctors rushed back and forth to tend to wounded or lifeless bodies carried on stretchers or by wailing relatives. With beds occupied, many casualties were receiving care on the bare floor. But Al-Shifa Hospital is inside the area covered by Israel\u2019s evacuation warning. The director, Mohammed Abu Silmiya, who warned the hospital was running out of surgical and medical supplies and was down to two days worth of fuel to run its generators, said he could not abandon hundreds of patients dependent on ventilators, dialysis and intensive care. \u201cI have nowhere to take the wounded, the children, the women and the dead,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t vacate the hospital.

        "text": " By Giulio Piovaccari MILAN (Reuters) - Ferrari has started to accept payment in cryptocurrency for its luxury sports cars in the U.S. and will extend the scheme to Europe following requests from its wealthy customers, its marketing and commercial chief told Reuters. The vast majority of blue-chip companies have steered clear of crypto as the volatility of bitcoin and other tokens renders them impractical for commerce. Patchy regulation and high energy usage have also prevented the spread of crypto as a means of payment. These include electric carmaker Tesla, which in 2021 began to accept payment in bitcoin, the biggest crypto coin, before CEO Elon Musk halted it because of environmental concerns. Ferrari's Chief Marketing and Commercial Officer Enrico Galliera told that Reuters cryptocurrencies had made efforts to reduce their carbon footprint through the introduction of new software and a larger use of renewable sources. \"Our target to reach for carbon neutrality by 2030 along our whole value chain is absolutely confirmed,\" he said in an interview. Ferrari said the decision came in response to requests from the market and dealers as many of its clients have invested in crypto. \"Some are young investors who have built their fortunes around cryptocurrencies,\" he said. \"Some others are more traditional investors, who want to diversify their portfolios.\" While some cryptocurrencies, such as the second-largest, ether, have improved their energy efficiency, bitcoin still attracts criticism for its energy-intensive mining. Ferrari shipped more than 1,800 cars to its Americas region, which includes the U.S., in the first half of this year. Galliera did not say how many cars Ferrari expected to sell through crypto. He said the company's order portfolio was strong and fully booked well into 2025, but the company wanted to test this expanding universe. \"This will help us connect to people who are not necessarily our clients but might afford a Ferrari,\" he said. The Italian company, which sold 13,200 cars in 2022, with prices starting at over 200,000 euros ($211,000) and going up to 2 million euros, plans to extend the crypto scheme to Europe by the first quarter of next year and then to other regions where crypto is legally accepted. Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) is Ferrari's largest region, accounting for 46% of its total car shipments in the first half of this year. \"Interest is the same in the U.S. and Europe, we don't see huge differences,\" Galliera said. Countries where cryptocurrencies are restricted include China. Ferrari has turned to one of the biggest cryptocurrency payment processors, BitPay, for the initial phase in the U.S., and will allow transactions in bitcoin, ether and USDC, one of the largest so-called stablecoins. Ferrari might use other payment processors in different regions. \"Prices will not change, no fees, no surcharges if you pay through cryptocurrencies,\" Galliera said. Bitpay will immediately turn cryptocurrency payments into traditional currency on behalf of Ferrari's dealers, so they are protected from price swings. \"This was one of our main goals: avoiding, both our dealers and us, to directly handle cryptocurrencies and being shielded from their wide fluctuations,\" Galliera said. As the payment processor, BitPay will ensure that the virtual currencies come from legitimate sources and not derived from criminal activity or to be used to launder the proceeds of crime or evade tax. Ferrari's marketing and commercial chief said that the majority of its U.S. dealers have already signed up, or are about to agree, to the scheme \"I am confident others will join soon,\" Galliera said.

        "text": " (Repeats story that ran on Friday, with no changes) By Sarita Chaganti Singh NEW DELHI, Oct 13 (Reuters) - India wants to push developed nations to become carbon negative rather than carbon neutral by 2050, arguing that would allow emerging market economies more time to use fossil fuels for development needs, two Indian government sources said. India, which is resisting calls to commit to a deadline for phasing out its own use of coal and other fossil fuels, is set to make its proposal at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai later this year. \"The rich countries should become net negative emitters before 2050 to enable the world to achieve the target of global net-zero by that year while allowing developing nations to use the available natural resources for growth,\" one of the government officials said. Developed countries including the United States, Britain, Canada and Japan are targeting net zero by 2050. China has committed to net zero by 2060 while India has committed to reaching that goal by 2070. Net zero or carbon neutrality means the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere through any activity is offset by an additional activity to remove an equivalent amount. Carbon negative is a step forward and requires a country to remove more CO2 from the atmosphere than it emits. COP28 discussions are taking place at a time when extreme weather-related events have lead to heatwaves and erratic monsoons and scientists have called for immediate action. India intends to continue resisting developed economies' push to fix a deadline for fossil fuel phase down and instead favours shifting focus to reducing overall carbon emissions through \"abatement and mitigation technologies,\" the two officials and a third government official said. None of the officials wished to be named as the discussions are private and a final stance has not been firmed up. India's environment, external affairs and prime minister's offices did not reply to emails seeking comment. India has committed to operating half of its installed power capacity with non-fossil sources and cutting the ratio of greenhouse emissions to gross domestic product to 45% of its 2005 level by 2030. At a summit in New Delhi last month G20 countries accepted the need to phase-down unabated coal power, but stopped short of setting a timeline or emission reduction goals. The declaration was a step forward in climate negotiations, with the 20 countries accounting for over 80% of global emissions agreeing to phase down coal for the first time. The decision was a surprise as coal-dependent economies, including China, India and Indonesia, have in past negotiations resisted talks of exiting the black fuel and asked developed economies to instead end their use of gas. \"It's just not feasible for India to commit to a timeline to end coal. Coal is going to be the country's mainstay in the near future even if storage and abatement technologies become viable in a hypothetic situation,\" another official said. Data shows that thermal power stations provide 73% of electricity consumed in India, even though the country has increased its non-fossil capacity to 44% of its total installed power generation capacity. COP28 is scheduled to take place between Nov. 30 and Dec. 12. (Reporting by Sarita Chaganti Singh; Editing by Susan Fenton)"

        "text": " (Bloomberg) -- With 4.3% unemployment, the UK economy would seem to be holding up well against a barrage of headwinds. But by one reliable measure, the jobless rate may already be telegraphing a recession. Most Read from Bloomberg Israel Latest: Army Says Over 600,000 Gazans Have Fled South US Pushes Bid to Avert Wider Israel War After Iran Warning Israel Latest: Biden and Abbas Talk as Gaza Invasion Nears Your Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas War Global Markets Stable as US Pushes to Contain Middle East War The so-called \u201cSahm rule\u201d suggests the UK is undergoing the steepest rise in unemployment in the developed world, deepening recession fears that are growing by the day in the City of London. The rule flashing red shows that a once red-hot labor market is quickly turning cold, potentially providing a final shove for a lackluster economy and dealing another blow to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. The closely watched rule in economic circles indicates the start of a recession when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises by 0.5 percentage points or more relative to the low during the previous 12 months. The historical pattern was found by US economist Claudia Sahm, who worked as a senior economist for the Federal Reserve Board and the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. It has retrospectively been correct on every US recession since the 1960s and also has a strong record in the UK. It signaled every UK recession since the mid-1970s but was slightly late to the pandemic downturn because unemployment was depressed by the furlough program that subsidized workers\u2019 wages. It also sent two false positives during the eurozone debt crisis and before the financial crisis. Since hitting a near half-century low of 3.5% last year, unemployment in the UK has risen by 0.8 percentage points to 4.3%, pushing past the 0.5 point red line stipulated by the rule. Analysis by Nomura showed that, under the Sahm rule, this rise in joblessness relative to the previous 12-month trough was much greater in the UK than all of the major eurozone economies, the US and Japan. By comparison, unemployment is up just 0.1 point in the US and Germany, 0.2 point in France and is lower in Spain and Italy. Once a point of strength, the UK jobs market is becoming another major headwind. It means a recession could arrive shortly before Britons vote at a general election widely expected next year. With the Conservatives trailing the opposition Labour Party in the polls, Sunak has made growing the economy one of his key pledges. \u201cThere have been a number of data lately that have suggested the economy is creaking, but the rise in the unemployment rate is the one that concerns us the most,\u201d said Dan Hanson, senior UK economist at Bloomberg Economics, who predicts a recession from the fourth quarter. \u201cJoblessness tends to rise rapidly during recessions, which feeds back negatively onto spending. A big jump could mean our own forecast for a modest downturn is too optimistic.\u201d Joblessness, depressed by pandemic labor shortages, is now starting to climb as the economy struggles under the weight of higher interest rates and the worst cost-of-living crisis for decades. Figures due later this month are forecast to show unemployment held at 4.3% in the three months to August. However, it is then expected to climb again heading into 2024, possibly topping 5%. George Buckley, chief UK economist at Nomura, also believes the jobs market will be a key driver that helps tip the UK into recession. \u201cThe labor market combined with a lot of other factors, including higher interest rates, a weaker housing market and high inflation which is still dampening real wage growth, are all negatives for GDP,\u201d he said. Rising joblessness is perhaps better news for the BOE. Officials tasked with bringing rampant inflation back to target are alarmed that salaries are growing at a record pace almost two years after they began raising interest rates \u2014 threatening a wage-price spiral. The central bank is growing increasingly confident that the jobs market is now responding to its 14 back-to-back interest rate rises, with survey data already showing weakness on wages. Money markets show traders think rates, at 5.25%, are at or close to a peak. Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said last week there are \u201cclear signs\u201d the the monetary tightening is weighing the economy, including on employment. Fellow rate-setter Swati Dhingra said on Thursday that the odds of recession are evenly balanced, warning that most of the previous hikes are still yet to feed through. Tomasz Wieladek, chief European economist at T. Rowe Price, said central bankers will be increasingly inclined to look through official earnings data, which have yet to register the slowdown evident in surveys. The labor market, he said, has historically been \u201clike an on-off switch\u201d \u2014 either tight or loose. \u201cAll of this evidence suggests that we are likely headed into the \u2018off-state\u2019 of the UK labor market,\u201d he said. \u201cUnemployment will likely be much higher going forward. In the past 50 years, moving into the \u2018off-state\u2019 of the labor market, which is where we are headed now, was associated with recession five out of six times.\u201d Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek The K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTS Introducing The Businessweek Show With Max Abelson Has Bob Iger Lost the Magic?

On Friday, Borrell met Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who described the talks as \"comprehensive, candid and friendly\". The two discussed EU-China trade tensions and a broad range of hot-button issues, including the Israel-Hamas conflict and China using its influence on Russia to stop its war in Ukraine. \"We are facing a critical moment in Gaza and we cannot say that the problem in Gaza will be solved by the two-state solution because the world has been failing miserably,\" Borrell said on Saturday. \"But what we discussed with my Chinese counterpart is that it is the only solution that can be implemented,\" he added. JUST AN INVESTIGATION The EU's record $426 billion trade deficit last year with the world's second-largest economy has become a major sticking point in the relationship. Last week Brussels launched an investigation into whether to impose tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle (EV) imports it says benefit from state subsidies. \"We have a lot of geopolitical issues to consider, but certainly this was discussed, and I told my Chinese counterpart that to launch an investigation is just to launch an investigation,\" Borrell said. During talks in Beijing last month, China's economy tsar, He Lifeng, asked EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis to \"exercise restraint in the use of trade remedy measures\". The EU plans to open an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese steelmakers this month, the Financial Times has reported. Beijing has also objected to EU plans for a \"carbon border adjustment mechanism\" that will set tariffs of 20% to 35% on goods with a high carbon price, such as steel and iron ore. The EU and China plan a summit by the end of the year, with Borrell's visit and those of a number of other top EU officials in recent months having paved the way.

        "text": " SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California will raise the minimum wage for health care workers to $25 per hour over the next decade under a new law Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Friday. The new law is the second minimum wage increase Newsom has signed. Last month, he signed a law raising the minimum wage for fast food workers to $20 per hour. Both wage increases are the result of years of lobbying by labor unions, which have significant sway in the state\u2019s Democratic-dominated Legislature. \u201cCalifornians saw the courage and commitment of healthcare workers during the pandemic, and now that same fearlessness and commitment to patients is responsible for a historic investment in the workers who make our healthcare system strong and accessible to all,\u201d said Tia Orr, executive director of the Service Employees International Union California. The wage increase for health care workers reflects a carefully crafted compromise in the final days of the legislative session between the health care industry and labor unions to avoid some expensive ballot initiative campaigns. Several city councils in California had already passed local laws to raise the minimum wage for health care workers. The health care industry then qualified referendums asking voters to block those increases. Labor unions responded by qualifying a ballot initiative in Los Angeles that would limit the maximum salaries for hospital executives. The law Newsom signed Friday would preempt those local minimum wage increases. It was somewhat unexpected for Newsom to sign the law. His administration had expressed concerns about the bill previously because of how it would impact the state\u2019s struggling budget. California\u2019s Medicaid program is a major source of revenue for many hospitals. The Newsom administration had warned the wage increase would have caused the state to increase its Medicaid payments to hospitals by billions of dollars. Labor unions say raising the wages of health care workers will allow some to leave the state\u2019s Medicaid program, plus other government support programs that pay for food and other expenses. A study by the University of California-Berkely Labor Center found almost half of low-wage health care workers and their families use these publicly funded programs. Researchers predicted those savings would offset the costs to the state. The $25 minimum wage had been a point of negotiations between Kaiser Permanente and labor unions representing about 75,000 workers. Those workers went on strike for three days last week. Both sides announced a tentative deal Friday. The strike came in a year when there have been work stoppages within multiple industries, including transportation, entertainment and hospitality. The health care industry has been confronted with burnout from heavy workloads, a problem greatly exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic."

Nahle, a 59-year-old chemical engineer who has held office since late 2018, said last month she may run for governor of Veracruz, which borders the Gulf of Mexico and is rich in oil and gas. \"She will be with us in the position until today,\" Lopez Obrador said, wishing her the best and thanking her for her work notably on Dos Bocas, a major oil refinery for state producer Pemex in Tabasco that is set to reach full capacity this year. The refinery aims to help Mexico become energy self-sufficient but has not yet begun to market its products. In next year's elections, Nahle could compete on behalf of the ruling MORENA party for governorship against Miguel Angel Yunes of the conservative PAN party, a former Veracruz governor who could seek a comeback to his old office. Late on Friday, MORENA published a list of its pre-candidates for Veracruz, which alongside Nahle include deputies Sergio Gutierrez Luna and Claudia Tello and the state's former party president, Manuel Huerta. The list also includes Eric Cisneros and Zenyazen Escobar, who resigned from their posts as Veracruz government secretary and education secretary, respectively. The current state governor is MORENA's Cuitlahuac Garcia. Nahle sent a message on social messaging platform X thanking Lopez Obrador. \"It's an honor,\" she said. \"Mission accomplished!\".

        "text": " * All six states reject Voice proposal, TV networks project * On national count, 60% of voters reject proposal * Rejections seen as a setback for reconciliation (Updates with comments from Prime Minister Albanese in paragraphs 6-7) By Praveen Menon, Lewis Jackson and Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Australia on Saturday decisively rejected a proposal to recognise Indigenous people in the constitution, in a major setback to the country's efforts for reconciliation with its First Peoples. Australians had to vote \"Yes\" or \"No\" in the referendum, the first in almost a quarter of a century, on the question of whether to alter the constitution to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people through the creation of an Indigenous advisory body, the \"Voice to Parliament\". Nationwide, with almost 70% of the vote counted, the \"No\" vote led \"Yes\" 60% to 40%. Australian broadcaster ABC and other TV networks have projected that a majority of voters in all six of Australia's states would vote against altering the 122-year-old constitution. A successful referendum requires at least four of the six to vote in favour, along with a national majority. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese acknowledged it was not the outcome he had hoped for but said the country would have to seek a new way forward for reconciliation. \"Our nation's road to reconciliation has often been hard going,\" Albanese said in a televised news conference. \"Tonight is not the end of the road and is certainly not the end of our efforts to bring people together.\" Academics and human rights advocates fear the win by the \"No\" camp could set back reconciliation efforts by years. The Voice to Parliament was proposed in the Uluru Statement from the Heart, a 2017 document crafted by Indigenous leaders that set out a roadmap for reconciliation with wider Australia. Australia's Indigenous citizens, who make up 3.8% of the country's 26 million population, have inhabited the land for about 60,000 years but are not mentioned in the constitution and are, by most socio-economic measures, the most disadvantaged people in the country. Supporters of the proposal believed entrenching an Indigenous Voice into the constitution would unite Australia and usher in a new era with its Indigenous people. Many Indigenous people favoured the change, but some said it was a distraction from achieving practical and positive outcomes. The political opposition has criticised the measure, saying it is divisive, would be ineffective, and would slow government decision-making. \"I'm devastated,\" Indigenous leader and prominent \"Yes\" campaigner Thomas Mayo said on ABC News. \"We need a Voice. We need that structural change.\" SETBACK FOR ALBANESE Referendums are difficult to pass in Australia, with only eight of 44 succeeding since the country's founding in 1901. This is the first referendum in Australia since voters rejected a proposal to become a republic almost a quarter of a century ago. In 1967, a referendum to count Indigenous people as part of the Australian population was a resounding success with bipartisan political support. This year's referendum, however, has not garnered unified support, with leaders of the major conservative parties campaigning for a \"No\" vote. No referendum has passed in Australia without bipartisan backing. The Voice has been a key feature of Prime Minister Albanese's term in office, and a referendum loss would stand out, political analysts say, as his biggest setback since coming to power in May last year. Opposition leader Peter Dutton criticised Albanese for holding a referendum \"that Australia did not need to have\". \"The proposal and the process should have been designed to unite Australians, not to divide us,\" he told a news conference after the result was known on Saturday. A misinformation campaign that spread through social media also sparked fear that the Voice - a purely advisory body - would become a third chamber of parliament, resulting in more federal aid to Aboriginal people, and more disputes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. Albanese also criticised some sections of the media that he said had steered the referendum debate away from the core issues. \"We have had, including in outlets represented in this room, discussions about a range of things that were nothing to do with what was on the ballot paper tonight,\" Albanese said.

        "text": " MEXICO CITY, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Mexico Energy Secretary Rocio Nahle has presented her resignation and will step down immediately, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday, following hints from Nahle she might enter the race for governor of Veracruz state. Nahle, a 59-year-old chemical engineer who has held office since late 2018, has given indications she may run for governor of the state of Veracruz, which borders the Gulf of Mexico and is rich in oil and gas. \"She will be with us in the position until today,\" Lopez Obrador said, wishing her the best and thanking her for her work notably on Dos Bocas, a major oil refinery for state producer Pemex in Tabasco that is set to reach full capacity this year. The refinery aims to help Mexico become energy self-sufficient but has not yet begun to market its products. Nahle could compete for governorship in next year's elections alongside MORENA party Deputy Sergio Gutierrez Luna and Miguel Angel Yunes of the conservative PAN, a former Veracruz governor who could seek a comeback to his old office. The position is currently held by MORENA's Cuitlahuac Garcia. Nahle sent a message on social messaging platform X thanking Lopez Obrador. \"It's an honor,\" she said. \"Mission accomplished!\".

        "text": " (Bloomberg) -- In March, a 39-year-old woman and her husband sat in a fertility clinic near Atlanta, and waited. The woman was there to have an embryo implanted in her uterus, the final stage of a grueling in vitro fertilization process involving hormone injections, multiple egg retrievals and more than $30,000 of the couple\u2019s savings. Most Read from Bloomberg Israel Latest: Army Says Over 600,000 Gazans Have Fled South US Pushes Bid to Avert Wider Israel War After Iran Warning Israel Latest: Biden and Abbas Talk as Gaza Invasion Nears Your Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas War Global Markets Stable as US Pushes to Contain Middle East War Three hours passed. Then a doctor emerged with jarring news: The embryo that the clinic had been storing \u2014 the couple\u2019s last one \u2014 had been mislabeled. Staff couldn\u2019t be sure it was hers. The woman broke down. All this effort, all this money, only to learn it might\u2019ve all been for nothing, thought the woman, who asked not to be identified discussing the private ordeal. \"I went crazy just crying and crying,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was our only opportunity.\u201d Her account was corroborated by four employees who were present that day and requested anonymity discussing private information. The Atlanta-area clinic and 32 others across the country are owned by Kindbody, a five-year-old startup founded by Gina Bartasi. She\u2019s a well-known figure in the fertility world whose reputation and millennial-friendly marketing has attracted hundreds of millions of venture capital dollars to Kindbody, as well as celebrity investors including Gwyneth Paltrow, Chelsea Clinton and Gabrielle Union. But beneath the firm\u2019s Instagrammable aesthetic lies a bonus-driven business model, a number of understaffed clinics and instances of inconsistent safety protocols that have plagued some operations and contributed to errors like the one in Atlanta, according to three dozen current and former employees and patients interviewed by Bloomberg. The people, many of whom spoke anonymously for fear of retaliation by the company, include doctors, nurse practitioners, medical assistants, laboratory professionals as well as staff in operations, finance and sales. Examples of embryos being mislabeled, lost or accidentally destroyed occurred in four clinics over the past three years, according to two current employees and a dozen former employees. Staff at six clinics said their labs had faulty heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, factors that could harm embryo quality, and that the company moved ahead with expansion plans anyway. As Kindbody has rapidly grown \u2014 acquiring a competitor, winning corporate benefits contracts with companies including Walmart Inc. and Tesla Inc., and courting investment banks to prepare for a public listing \u2014 many of the former and current employees say the quality of care provided in some clinics has slipped, and described a culture of pushing costly procedures to meet financial targets. \u201cIVF can be a risky business and accidents happen,\u201d said Mina Alikani, an embryologist and consultant to providers setting up IVF labs. But the frequency of mishaps at the startup, as described to her by Bloomberg, are \u201cconcerning,\u201d she said. A spokeswoman for Kindbody strongly disputed the characterization that the company was understaffed or struggled to staff clinics and labs. She acknowledged the mislabeling in Atlanta, and said \u201cthis human error was identified and corrected because of our superior technology.\u201d The company said its average incident rate across all clinics is 0.2%, which it says is similar to other leading US programs as detailed in a 2018 study by Boston IVF. It added that \u201cno Kindbody laboratory has had an incident, accident or other issue that is unusual to what occurs in IVF laboratories generally.\u201d In a statement provided by Kindbody, Steven Katz \u2014 the chief executive officer of REI Protect, a risk management and insurance company for IVF clinics including Kindbody \u2014 said that Kindbody\u2019s incident rates are in the lowest quartile of the clinics that he covers. \u200b\u200bKatz told Bloomberg that his firm covers about half of all fertility doctors and IVF labs in the country. Booming Industry The fertility industry worldwide has boomed in recent years, fueled by shifts in social norms, a desire among some people to postpone childbearing and rising rates of infertility among some populations. The number of assisted reproductive technology procedures \u2014 mostly IVF \u2014 hit 413,776 in 2021, up 78% from 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The global fertility market was worth about $35.2 billion last year and is expected to grow to $84 billion by 2028, according to market research firm Imarc. Kindbody\u2019s challenges underscore the risks facing an industry that, on one hand, focuses on expensive, painstakingly precise biological procedures while at the same time pursuing a growth path funded by investors intent on an eventual return on their money. No IVF cycle is without risk: Significant incidents, like the mishandling of eggs or embryos that results in the loss or significant compromise of a cycle, occur once every 2,156 cycles, according to the 2018 Boston IVF study, which tracked one of its own laboratories over 12 years. Moderate problems, which might reduce the chance of success for a cycle, happened once every 555 cycles. At Kindbody, the Bryant Park, New York, clinic had three incidents involving embryos in 2021, according to one current and eight former employees. That\u2019s out of 830 total IVF cycles it started that year, according to data provided by Kindbody to the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART), which tracks cycles and success rates among its member clinics. In one case, a patient who was scheduled to have an embryo thawed and implanted was told that the wrong embryo \u2014 one that she hadn\u2019t been planning to use \u2014 had been accidentally defrosted, said Tracy Sosa, a former medical assistant assigned to the case. The patient and her partner were encouraged to move forward with the procedure, but it didn\u2019t result in a successful pregnancy, an outcome that can happen for many reasons. The couple declined to comment about the incident. \u201cPatients walk in enamored by the look of the place and think they\u2019ll be taken care of,\u201d said Sosa. \u201cTo the company, they\u2019re just a number.\u201d That same year, the Bryant Park clinic accidentally destroyed at least two other embryos, one current and two former employees said. One was dropped on the ground. Another, a patient\u2019s last embryo, was damaged after accidentally being left out at room temperature. The woman was given unlimited free IVF to make up for the mistake, but didn\u2019t conceive and ultimately stopped treatment at Kindbody, according to two senior employees who are still at the company. In a statement, Kindbody acknowledged the incidents at the Bryant Park clinic but again pointed to the company\u2019s overall 0.2% incident rate, while declining to give individual rates for its clinics. The company noted that Sosa worked in the company\u2019s Princeton, New Jersey, clinic and said it has not had a major incident at any clinic. It strongly disputed the idea that patients are just a number, saying they\u2019re the company\u2019s \u201cnorth star.\u201d Kindbody also provided 21 positive comments about the company\u2019s services that, it said, were collected in August from 21 unidentified patients. Kindbody conducts a root-cause analysis after incidents, including the ones Bloomberg raised, and corrects processes where necessary, the company spokeswoman said. Kindbody said its overall live birth success rate is 63%, compared to a national average of 43% as reported to SART. Modern, Inclusive When Bartasi founded Kindbody in 2018, it was her third venture in the industry. She\u2019d previously started FertilityAuthority, an IVF referral network, which went on to become fertility benefits company Progyny. With Kindbody, Bartasi wanted to sell directly to consumers and employers, pitching it as a modern, more-inclusive service. Some of Kindbody\u2019s first employees said the early days were characteristic of any young company: fast-paced and chaotic, with an ambitious founder. In meetings, potential backers were impressed by Bartasi\u2019s charisma, confidence and track record. \u201cShe\u2019s one in a million,\u201d said Stephen Hays, founder of What If Ventures, which backed Kindbody in 2021. The company got its start offering free hormone tests and consultations in yellow buses across San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and the Hamptons. When it opened brick-and-mortar clinics, they were outfitted with warm tones, fresh flower arrangements and gallery walls of abstract art depicting the female body. It hired executives from Equinox, OneMedical and Oscar Health. \u201cKindbody is different than other players in the space because they have good outcomes without sacrificing the experience,\u201d said Andrew Boyd, a partner at Bramalea Partners who invested in 2021. \u201cYou get that spa-like experience versus walking into a four-story medical center that\u2019s next to a hospital with crappy parking.\u201d That\u2019s part of what attracted Sophia Visanji, a 33-year-old optometrist who\u2019d been contemplating freezing her eggs for years before walking into Kindbody\u2019s clinic in New York City\u2019s Flatiron district. \u201cI had done some consultations at other clinics and Kindbody was very thoughtful and made me feel comfortable. It was millennial, picturesque, instagrammable,\u201d said Visanji, adding that the staff were \u201creally warm.\u201d In total, Visanji said she paid about $9,000 and still stores her eggs with Kindbody. Kindbody\u2019s mission of making treatment more accessible hinged on making it cheaper for companies to offer it to employees. Once a handful of clinics were up and running, Bartasi started pitching: Early clients included Tesla Inc., Lyft Inc. and Rivian Automotive Inc. In its first three years, Kindbody opened nine clinics and raised more than $123 million, according to data from PitchBook. Kindbody said that by building and operating its own clinics and labs, it could offer employers fertility services for their staff at 30% cheaper than competitors. But running those labs at the level needed to safely handle embryos has proved difficult in some instances, many of the former and current employees said. In the months leading up to the Atlanta woman\u2019s experience, that clinic had gone through periods when there was only one embryologist on site, according to four former employees, including Vernita Pearsall, who started as a practice manager in September 2022 and quit in March. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) recommends at least two embryologists be present while eggs and embryos are handled. Kindbody had struggled to staff its labs since the clinic opened in 2021, and shortages meant the protocol wasn\u2019t consistently followed, four former employees said. Kindbody said that \u201ctypically, there are two embryologists present in Atlanta during procedures,\u201d depending on the volume of procedures scheduled. On the day of the March incident when the woman\u2019s embryo was found to be mislabeled, two senior embryologists were present, a spokeswoman said. Nurses, medical assistants and lab staff also were sometimes too overwhelmed with day-to-day work to write up detailed accounts of any errors, a dozen current and former employees, including Pearsall, said. In a statement, Kindbody said it made improvements after the March incident, including extra requirements for verifying labels and color-coding dishes. The company also said it reports, investigates and takes corrective action if incidents occur, including in each example that Bloomberg found. Industry Oversight There is no regulatory framework requiring fertility clinics to track lost, mishandled or destroyed embryos, though they are required by law to report birth rates to the CDC. Meanwhile, several government agencies oversee aspects of IVF but don\u2019t enforce standards, leaving a patchwork of state-by-state rules. The CDC, for example, tracks which labs are certified by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, a federal statute that regulates testing. But while tests on blood and semen fall under its remit, embryology testing doesn\u2019t. To fill the gap, nonprofit organizations and industry groups like the College of American Pathologists accredit IVF labs, sending in an inspection team every two years. Kindbody\u2019s labs are listed on CAP\u2019s database of accredited reproductive laboratories. Unlike most competitors, Kindbody operates its own embryology labs, controlling variables such as temperature, humidity and air flow. Air quality is especially critical because contaminants such as perfume or rubbing alcohol can affect an embryo\u2019s quality, according to Alikani, the embryologist. The ASRM\u2019s practice guidelines recommend \u201cdedicated clean air into the laboratory...to limit particles, volatile organic compounds, and inorganic air pollutants.\u201d Kindbody\u2019s Bryant Park location struggled with malfunctioning HVAC systems as early as 2020, but the company opened other new clinics before fixing issues at existing ones, according to six former and one current employee. Though clinics in 2021 in Austin and Atlanta passed the necessary inspections to open, problems surfaced quickly, employees said. In Austin, a sewer pipe that released foul-smelling gasses into the clinic took weeks to fix, three former employees said. In the Atlanta clinic, the ceiling above the nursing station collapsed and unleashed a flood of water from the HVAC system, current and former employees said. The clinic, which had only been open for a few months, was temporarily shut down. The disruption didn\u2019t coincide with the mislabeling incident at the same location. In a statement, Kindbody acknowledged the disruptions in both of the clinics, saying the company took immediate action and that no patients, tissue or embryos were directly impacted. Regarding the Austin problem, Kindbody said in a statement that \u201cat this time, the pipe is repaired and the odor has subsided in the IVF lab.\u201d It said that \u201cto suggest that Kindbody\u2019s laboratories are substandard and not meeting industry norms is false. Most recently, about two weeks ago, Kindbody's clinic in Santa Monica experienced a flood that affected lab operations, two people with direct knowledge of the situation said, asking not to be identified because the information isn\u2019t public. The company confirmed on Friday that the space above its Santa Monica clinic \u2014 located in an office building \u2014 experienced a leak, resulting in water coming down into its clinic. Patient care was relocated to a partner clinic operated by Pinnacle Fertility, it said, and patients will continue to go to the Pinnacle clinic \u201cuntil the situation is remediated.\u201d Doubling Clinics The momentum of openings helped Kindbody raise another $62 million in 2021. That capital was used to fund the acquisition of a large, established Chicago-based fertility network, Vios Fertility Institute. The deal doubled Kindbody\u2019s physical locations to 26 clinics, and the company quickly renovated the new locations to match its spa-like aesthetic. Trying to meld the different cultures of the companies was difficult, according to two current and more than a dozen former employees. The clash contributed to an exodus of employees and took a significant toll on laboratory leadership, according to dozens of current and former employees. At least four of the company\u2019s senior lab directors have quit since 2022, including Chief Scientific Officer Dean Morbeck, a veteran IVF researcher who oversaw laboratory practices. Morbeck didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. And in the months after the acquisition, more errors started surfacing. Last November, a call came into the West Loop clinic in Chicago. The facility was then Kindbody\u2019s largest location, and conducted about 40% of all egg retrievals in the first half of last year, internal documents show. The patient on the line wanted to have her frozen embryo screened for abnormalities, according to one current and two former employees. There was one problem, they said: It was nowhere to be found. The clinic\u2019s electronic records showed a unique identifier that corresponded to a storage tank and individual cylinder where the embryo was supposed to be. But the vial wasn\u2019t there. Staff members unfamiliar with some of the systems scrambled to find the embryo, according to the people who were present and spoke on the condition of anonymity due to confidentiality agreements. The misplaced embryo was found later that day, though staff members weren\u2019t given an explanation for why the vial wasn\u2019t in the right place. The incident raised alarm among staff, who grew worried about the impact the acquisition was having on patients. They questioned how the company could continue to expand when, in their view, its busiest clinic was buckling under pressure, six current and former employees said. Kindbody said that issues can arise when embryos are transferred to Kindbody from another clinic or a patient changes their name. Fertility experts said that electronic tracking, like a system called RI Witness, can help minimize some human errors. While Kindbody bought the technology as it was opening clinics, some staff said it wasn\u2019t widely installed and they weren\u2019t properly trained on how to operate it, former senior employees said. A spokeswoman for Kindbody said this was \u201ccompletely inaccurate,\u201d that RI Witness is now used in 90% of Kindbody labs and that it worked to catch the mislabeled embryo in Atlanta. It will \u201cbe fully integrated by the end of this year in our two remaining Kindbody clinics and lab staff has been fully trained to use the technology,\u201d according to a statement. Kindbody said less than a quarter of all fertility labs in the US use RI Witness, a number that was confirmed by a person with knowledge of the technology\u2019s reach. CooperSurgical, which owns the RI Witness system, didn\u2019t respond to requests about how many total clinics use its technology. Losing Money In March, Kindbody raised $100 million in debt from one of its biggest backers, Perceptive Advisors, valuing the company at $1.8 billion. Kindbody said it would use the money to open 10 new clinics, make more acquisitions and reach profitability by the end of 2023. The same month, the company had a round of layoffs that eliminated at least 100 jobs, according to four employees. A $25 million infusion from JPMorgan\u2019s healthcare venture arm, Morgan Health, followed in May. Kindbody said it cut some duplicate roles after the Vios deal, but that the company hasn\u2019t had widespread layoffs, and had 823 employees in September compared to 826 a year ago. In that same period it opened three new clinics. Meanwhile, some older clinics, like the one in Atlanta, are still losing money, according to two people familiar with the company\u2019s financial position. A spokeswoman for Kindbody said that rising operational costs and inflation had affected profitability. Kindbody\u2019s sales culture also encouraged doctors and nurses to push patients into expensive services, according to people familiar with the practice. A large portion of doctors\u2019 bonuses depend on how many consultations they were able to convert into treatment, one current and two former Kindbody doctors said. While bonuses are not uncommon in the industry, the doctors said the company scrutinized six-month and one-year targets more than other clinics at which they had worked. Each month, some doctors were given quotas \u2014 again, tied to annual bonuses \u2014 for the IVF cycles their clinics should do each month, current and former employees said. When numbers were low for the clinic, some were told to increase the number of \u201cdual stimulations,\u201d where a patient has two procedures to retrieve eggs in the same menstrual cycle, according to two former Kindbody doctors. The procedure is designed for women who produce relatively few eggs or urgently need more on the first retrieval, such as patients starting chemotherapy. It\u2019s relatively uncommon for an otherwise young, healthy patient, and studies have debated its effectiveness. Kindbody said its compensation model is consistent with models across the fertility industry, and that its \u201cphysicians retain independent medical judgment to determine the appropriate treatment plan for their patients and are not required to follow any specific protocol.\u201d Going Public As the company continues to grow, Kindbody\u2019s backers expect an initial public offering to be around the corner. In June, Kindbody hired Scott Bruckner, who led telecommunications company Casa Systems Inc. to its 2017 IPO, as its third CFO in three years. Kindbody has also garnered attention from investment banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., which have been vying to lead an eventual listing, according to people familiar with the matter, asking not to be identified because the information isn\u2019t public. Representatives for the banks declined to comment. \u201cThey\u2019re on a path to get there,\u201d said Bramalea Partners\u2019 Boyd. Growth helps a lot, he said. \u201cWe want to see more clinics set up, faster,\u201d said Boyd, who acknowledged there\u2019s a cost to building new clinics and it\u2019s not without risk. \u201cIf you make a mistake, it\u2019s painful.\u201d Back in Atlanta, the patient who\u2019d learned her embryo had been mislabeled was devastated. Because of the mix up, it needed to be genetically tested \u2014 a process that she had previously opted against and that can occasionally cause damage to an embryo. The clinic was eventually able to confirm the embryo was the couple\u2019s, but it was deemed abnormal and had to be discarded. While the woman was crushed by the experience, she was still determined to start a family. As restitution for its mistake, she said, Kindbody offered her a free IVF cycle, but it wasn\u2019t successful. She and her partner are now looking into adoption. --With assistance from Kristen V Brown.

More than 1,500 people have been killed in Gaza in retaliatory airstrikes. Palestinians in northern Gaza flooded streets in cars and on foot, heading south after Israel gave residents 24 hours to evacuate amid continued bombing and fears of a looming ground invasion against Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist group by the US and the European Union. The United Nations warned of a disaster and said it would be impossible to move the million or so inhabitants of north Gaza to the south, as demanded by Israeli authorities.

(All time stamps are Israeli time) Israel Hits Hezbollah Sites in Lebanon (3:50 a.m.) Israeli forces said strikes had been carried out on Hezbollah posts in southern Lebanon in response to \u201cunidentified\u201d objects that had entered northern Israelis airspace hours earlier The objects were shot down by unmanned Israeli aircraft, the Israel Defense Force said in a statement on Friday night. Hezbollah, a militia and political party that is backed by Iran, said earlier that it was prepared to act against Israel over its war in Gaza. The US designated Hezbollah as a terrorist organization in 1997. New York, Florida, Other States Buy Bonds (2 a.m.) Several US states have purchased Israeli bonds as the country enters a war with Hamas and looks to raise funds. The purchases include $20 million from the New York State Common Retirement Fund. \u201cNew York state\u2019s pension fund buys Israel bonds because we have confidence in the spirit of innovation and tenacity of Israeli people and in the strength of our investments there,\u201d New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said in a statement Friday. Public finance officials in Ohio, Florida, Texas and Illinois have also announced their own debt purchases. Pro-Palestinian Protesters March in Manhattan (1:10 a.m.) A pro-Palestine rally in Times Square drew thousands of protesters, who then marched to the Israeli consulate. The event, which also drew a smaller counterprotest, had significant police presence and has so far been without major incident. Some videos posted to social media show clashes between opposing demonstrators being broken up by the New York police. Moody\u2019s Skips Israel Credit Rating Notice (12:20 a.m.) Moody\u2019s has left Israel\u2019s sovereign credit rating unchanged at A1 with a stable outlook, after it decided to skip Friday\u2019s publication date and not issue a credit notice as planned, Israel\u2019s Finance Ministry said in an announcement. The next scheduled date for the publication of a credit rating notice by Moody\u2019s on Israel is in six months. Earlier this week, Moody\u2019s issued a note saying that the resilience of Israel\u2019s debt issuers is at stake if a conflict stretches on, impairing economic activity and policy making Biden Says US Will \u2018Surge\u2019 Humanitarian Aid to Gaza (10:32 p.m.) President Joe Biden said the US is coordinating with Arab countries and the United Nations to surge humanitarian aid to Gaza as Israel has warned Palestinians to flee ahead of an expected ground attack. Biden said aides had been communicating directly with the governments of Israel, Egypt, Jordan, among others, to \u201csurge support\u201d and humanitarian assistance. Israel\u2019s military toward residents in northern Gaza \u2013 estimated to be over 1 million people \u2013 to evacuate into the territory\u2019s south. \u201cThe overwhelming majority of Palestinians had nothing to do with Hamas, and Hamas\u2019s appalling attacks, and they\u2019re suffering as a result as well,\u201d Biden said. Netanyahu Says Israel Ready to Use \u2018Unprecedented\u2019 Force (10:28 p.m.) Prime Minister Netanyahu said Israelis understand they\u2019re \u201cfighting for our home\u201d after last weekend\u2019s attack and vowed to use \u201cunprecedented\u201d force against Hamas. \u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d he said in a brief televised speech as the country gears up for what\u2019s widely expected to be a ground invasion of Gaza. \u201cOur enemies have only begun to pay the price.\u201d Netanyahu said Israel was receiving support from President Biden and other leaders around the world, including additional ammunition and weapons. Foreigners May Be Allowed Brief Window to Leave Gaza, Canada Says (10:05 p.m.) Foreign citizens in Gaza may have a brief window to leave through the Rafah border crossing into Egypt on Saturday, a Canadian government official said in Ottawa. Julie Sunday, a foreign affairs department official, told reporters there is a potential departure window between 12 p.m. and 5 p.m. local time, and said the Canadian government is working with Israel and Egypt to get individuals approved to leave. She emphasized it is not yet guaranteed the crossing will be open, and said people should not go there until they are told they have clearance. Canadian officials said about 150 people in Gaza have registered with the government, though some are of mixed families. Fatal French Stabbing Linked to Israel-Hamas War by Top Official (9:40 p.m.) The assailant who fatally stabbed a teacher in France in what President Emmanuel Macron called an Islamist terror attack was possibly motivated by the war between Israel and Hamas, a top security official said. \u201cBased on our intelligence, on our information, there\u2019s probably a link between what happened in the Middle East and the decision to act,\u201d Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told broadcaster TF1 on Friday. France has stepped up security nationwide with more soldiers dispatched to help police, although there\u2019s \u201cno specific threat,\u201d he said. White House Meets Lawmakers On Aid Package for Israel, Ukraine (8:05 p.m.) Officials are meeting Friday with lawmakers about their request \u2014 expected next week \u2014 for a supplemental aid package to arm Israel and Ukraine, the White House said Friday. The fate of the funding package remains unclear as congressional Republicans remain split over whether to continue providing support to Ukraine - and who to name as the lower chamber\u2019s leader after the ouster of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Saudi Puts Normalization Talks With Israel on Hold in Blow to Biden (8:02 p.m.) Saudi Arabia has decided to pause diplomacy to normalize ties with Israel given the flareup in violence between Israeli forces and Hamas, people familiar with the matter said, in a major blow to President Joe Biden\u2019s ambitions for the Middle East. Saudi officials communicated Riyadh\u2019s position to the US in recent days, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private communications. They described the move as a pause and not as an end to the diplomacy. Suspending the talks runs counter to the Biden administration\u2019s push to proceed with normalization talks even in the wake of the latest violence. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is traveling to Saudi Arabia this weekend for talks. Too Early to Say Whether Hostage-Release Efforts Will Succeed, Qatari Says (7:15 p.m.) It\u2019s too early to say yet whether diplomatic efforts to win the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas will be successful, according to Qatar, a country widely seen as a likely potential mediator. \u201cThe progress will be determined in the next few days, hopefully, and we will see if there will be a positive prospect for that,\u201d Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told a press conference after talks with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. \u201cBut we are doing our best, our partners are doing their best in order to get them released safely.\u201d Israel Strikes Kill Reporter, Wound 2 Others on Lebanon Border (6:49 pm) Israel airstrikes on the southern Lebanese village of Alma Al-Shaab killed a reporter and wounded two others, Lebanon\u2019s state-run National News Agency said. Reuters said videographer Issam Abdallah was killed while providing a live video signal in southern Lebanon and said it was seeking more information. A reporter and a photographer with Al-Jazeera were wounded when Israel fire hit their car, the Arabic news network said. Israel Army Carries Out Local Raids in Gaza (7:21) Israel army said it has carried out local raids in Gaza in the past 24 hours in an effort to locate hostages and eliminate threats. In a statement, Israel Defense Forces said they searched and collected evidence that would assist in the effort to locate hostages. Soldiers also thwarted cells and infrastructure in the area. Biden Holds Call With Families of Missing Americans (7:16 p.m.) President Biden called family members of the 14 American citizens still unaccounted for following the Hamas-led attack over the weekend in Israel. The president was joined by top national security aides, including Roger Carstens, who serves as a special envoy responsible coordinating the US response to Americans being held hostage or unjustly detained overseas. The attacks killed 27 American citizens, according to the US. Hezbollah Says Launched Attack on Israel Army Posts Near Border (6:44pm) The Iran-backed Hezbollah group attacked four Israel military posts near the border with Lebanon in what it said was retaliation for strikes on several southern Lebanese towns, the group\u2019s Al-Manar TV reported. Israel Defense Forces said earlier they\u2019d responded to incoming fire in the area. Hezbollah said earlier Friday that it\u2019s prepared to act against Israel over its war in Gaza after its sponsor, Iran, warned the continued blockade of the Palestinian enclave could open up a new front in the conflict. \u201cWe are fully prepared \u2014 when the time comes \u2014 for any action that we will carry out,\u201d Hezbollah\u2019s Deputy Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qasem said, according to the group\u2019s Al Manar TV station. Israeli Poll Shows Netanyahu\u2019s Popularity Drops as Gantz Surges (6:00 p.m.) Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s popularity has dropped while that of Benny Gantz, a former general who\u2019s now part of Israel\u2019s \u201cwar cabinet,\u201d has surged, according to a poll conducted by Israeli research institutes. The survey, published by Maariv newspaper on Friday and carried out by Lazar Research in partnership with Panel4All, showed opposition parties would win a crushing majority against Netanyahu\u2019s coalition if elections were held now. Of the roughly 600 people surveyed, 48% said Gantz was their preferred prime minister, while 29% chose Netanyahu. World Bank to Continue Projects in Gaza, Official Says (5:45 p.m.) The World Bank is monitoring the situation and has no intention for now to suspend its programs and financing for Palestine, the lender\u2019s vice president for the MENA region Ferid Belhaj told Bloomberg in Marrakech. World Bank projects in Gaza pertain mostly to energy, water and sanitation and are funded out of the $80 million a year the lender grants the Palestinian Authority. Iran Diplomat Meets Hamas, Islamic Jihad in Beirut (5:13 p.m.) Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian discussed the situation in Gaza with senior officials from Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad in a meeting in Beirut, according to a statement. The visits followed an earlier meeting with the leader of Hezbollah, as Iran tries to rally regional support for Hamas\u2019s attacks while denying involvement in them. Amirabdollahian said Iran\u2019s \u201cdiplomatic efforts\u201d to end Israeli \u201cwar crimes\u201d in Gaza would continue. Explosion at Israeli Northern Border Prompts Artillery Fire Into Lebanon (4:58 p.m.) An explosion on the perimeter fence near the Israeli kibbutz of Hanita on the northern border caused limited damage, and Israel responded with artillery fire toward the source, the Israeli army said. There was also an alert that the community was infiltrated and troops are searching the area. Palestinians Flee South After Evacuation Order (4:56 pm) Previously deserted streets of Gaza City were flooded with Palestinians fleeing southward after Israel gave them 24 hours to evacuate this morning. The scale of the evacuation order\u2014which covers an area holding half of Gaza\u2019s population\u2014and of the flight are unprecedented. Still, many residents remain in the north, fearing the journey under bombardment and saying they have nowhere to go. Hamas has asked people to stay put, saying the order by Israel is misinformation. JP Morgan\u2019s Dimon Warns on Geopolitical Risks (4:30 p.m.) JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon warned of serious geopolitical risks amid expectations Israel will make a ground assault on Gaza. \u201cThis may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades,\u201d the CEO of the biggest US bank said in its third-quarter earnings statement. \u201cThe war in Ukraine compounded by last week\u2019s attacks on Israel may have far-reaching impacts on energy and food markets, global trade, and geopolitical relationships.\u201d Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek The K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTS Introducing The Businessweek Show With Max Abelson Has Bob Iger Lost the Magic?

        "text": " By Omar Younis LOS ANGELES, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Oscar winner George Clooney urged Hollywood studios on Friday to return to the bargaining table with striking actors to try and resolve their differences over a new labor contract. Negotiations between the studios and the SAG-AFTRA actors' union were suspended on Wednesday after studios rejected a demand for a bonus tied to the number of streaming TV subscribers. Clooney called the breakdown in talks \"worrisome.\" \"At least get in the room. Don't take a vacation,\" Clooney said when asked about the ongoing strike while attending a ceremony in Los Angeles at the Roybal School of Film and Television Production Magnet, which he co-founded. The \"Gravity\" actor said SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher had told him she was ready to restart talks to try to end the work stoppage that started in July. He said he hoped the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents Netflix, Walt Disney and other companies, would decide to come back and negotiate. \"Hopefully we can just get in a room and get this thing solved,\" he said. A spokesperson for the AMPTP did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Wednesday, the group said the gap between the parties was \"too great\" and that conversations were \"no longer moving us in a productive direction.\" The suspension in talks interrupted attempts to end labor tensions that have put most U.S.-based film and television production on hold, cost the California economy billions and left thousands of actors and crew members without work.

        "text": " (Edits details in paragraph 4 of 2109 GMT story) By Nidal al-Mughrabi and John Davison GAZA/JERUSALEM, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Israel was preparing on Saturday to launch a ground assault in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, after telling Palestinians living in the densely populated territory to flee south towards a closed border with Egypt. The Israeli national security adviser meanwhile warned Lebanese militant group Hezbollah not to start a war on a second front, threatening the \"destruction of Lebanon\" if it did. Israel has vowed to annihilate Hamas in retaliation for a rampage in which its fighters stormed through Israeli towns a week ago, shooting civilians and seizing scores of hostages in the worst attack on civilians in Israel's history. Some 1,300 people were killed in an onslaught that shocked Israel over the killing and graphic mobile phone footage and reports from medical and emergency services of atrocities in the towns and kibbutzes that were overrun. In response, Israeli jets and artillery have subjected Gaza to the most intense bombardment it has ever seen, putting the enclave, home to 2.3 million Palestinians, under total siege. Gaza authorities say more than 2,200 people have been killed, a quarter of them children, and nearly 10,000 wounded. Rescue workers searched desperately for survivors of nighttime air raids. Thousands of Palestinians fled the north of the Gaza Strip on Saturday from the path of the expected Israeli ground assault, while Israel pounded the area with more air strikes and said it kept two roads open to let people escape. U.S. President Joe Biden called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and, while reiterating \"unwavering\" support, discussed international coordination to ensure innocent civilians have access to water, food and medical care. Biden also spoke with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who stressed the urgent need to allow urgent humanitarian aid corridors in Gaza. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said Palestinians would \"remain in our land\" even as one million Gaza residents were reported to have fled their homes since Israel began its bombardment. The surprise Hamas attack on Oct. 7 launched the region into a new crisis as furious Israeli leaders prepare to respond with crushing force. \"IDF (Israel Defense Forces) soldiers and battalions are deployed across the country and are increasing operational readiness for the next stages of the war, with an emphasis on significant ground operations,\" the military said in a statement. It added this would include air, sea and land assaults and cover an \"expanded arena of combat,\" without elaborating. On Friday, the Israeli military told the population of the northern half of the Gaza Strip, which includes the enclave's biggest settlement Gaza City, to move south immediately. On Saturday, it said it would guarantee the safety of Palestinians fleeing on two main roads until 4:00 p.m. (1300 GMT). As the deadline passed, troops were massing around Gaza. Hamas has told people not to leave and says roads out are unsafe. It says dozens of people were killed in strikes on cars and trucks carrying refugees on Friday, which Reuters could not independently verify. Israel says Hamas is preventing people from leaving in order to use them as human shields, which Hamas denies. In one Gaza City neighborhood that Israel ordered evacuated, bombs fired from warplanes hit several houses during the night, residents said. \"We lived a night of horror. Israel punished us for not wanting to leave our home. Is there brutality worse than this?\" a father of three said by telephone from a hospital where he had taken shelter, declining to give his name for fear of reprisals. \"I prefer to die and not leave, but I can't see my wife and children die before my eyes.\" The Palestinian Red Crescent said it had received an Israeli order to evacuate the hospital by 4:00 p.m., but would not do so because it had a humanitarian duty to keep providing services to the sick and wounded. 'RELEASE OF THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN' The attacks on Israel have plunged the nation into deep grief and galvanised it for war, with hundreds of thousands of reservists mobilised within days. Avichai Brodetz, a farmer from Kibbutz Kfar Aza whose wife and three children were taken captive to Gaza, set up a camp outside the Israeli army headquarters to focus attention on the plight of kidnapped Israelis. \"The first thing that needs to happen is the release of the women and children,\" he told reporters. Hamas' armed wing said Israeli air strikes had killed nine captives including four foreigners overnight. Hamas had threatened to kill one hostage for every building Israel strikes without warning. Israel's attacks on Gaza failed to halt Hamas missile strikes deep into Israeli cities. The only route out of Gaza not under Israeli control was a checkpoint with Egypt at Rafah. Egypt officially says its side is open, but traffic has been halted for days because of Israeli strikes. Egyptian security sources said the Egyptian side is being reinforced and Cairo has no intention of accepting a mass influx of refugees. A U.S. State Department official said the United States was working to open the crossing to let some people out, and had been in touch with Palestinian-Americans who want to leave Gaza. Washington later said it had told its citizens to try to reach the crossing. The U.S. said on Saturday that 29 U.S. citizens were in killed in the Hamas attacks, with 15 unaccounted for, up from 27 previously. Countries and aid agencies have sent supplies to Egypt but have been unable to bring them into Gaza. Israel says nothing can enter through Rafah without its coordination. Israel says its evacuation order is a humanitarian gesture to protect residents while it roots out Hamas fighters. The United Nations says so many people cannot be safely moved within Gaza without causing a humanitarian disaster. HEZBOLLAH WARNING The violence in Gaza has been accompanied by the deadliest clashes at Israel's northern border with Lebanon since 2006, raising fears of war spreading to another front. Lebanon's armed Hezbollah movement, like Hamas a close ally of Iran, said it had fired at five Israeli outposts in the disputed Shebaa Farms area with guided missiles and mortar bombs. Reuters saw missiles fired at an Israeli army post and heard shelling from Israel and gunfire. Israel's Kan radio reported five border villages were under lockdown in response to a suspected incursion from Lebanon. Netanyahu security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said Israel was \"trying not to be drawn into a two-front war\" and warned Hezbollah to stay out of the fighting. \"We hope Hezbollah won't, de facto, bring about the destruction of Lebanon, because if there is a war there the result will be no less,\" he said, alluding to long-standing Israeli threats to launch heavy strikes on the country in a bid to stem launches of Hezbollah's extensive missile arsenal. Washington is also determined to ensure Iran and Iran-backed groups such as Lebanon's Hezbollah do not enter the conflict. The White House said Biden reiterated his warning on Saturday against anyone seeking to expand the conflict.

        "text": " (Updates Jefferies donations in paragraph 7, Citigroup CEO comments in paragraphs 10-12.) By Lananh Nguyen and Aditya Soni Oct 13 (Reuters) - As big U.S. corporations kicked off corporate earnings season this week, executives addressed the Israel-Hamas conflict and some companies launched fundraising efforts. \"I just want to say how deeply saddened that we all are about the recent horrific attacks on Israel ... Terrorism and hatred have no place in our civilized world,\" JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said on a post-earnings call before diving into results. He warned that the war in Ukraine, compounded by the attacks on Israel, could have \"far-reaching impacts on energy and food markets, global trade, and geopolitical relationships.\" On Thursday, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said: \"As the days have passed, the scope of the atrocities carried out against Israel and its citizens have become clearer and more horrific. It is not enough to condemn terrorism and the intentional targeting of civilians - we ourselves must take action.\" Fundraising efforts to relieve the crisis have been mobilized swiftly. Billionaires and members of the U.S. and Canadian Jewish community have contributed millions of dollars, military gear and clothing, and food and household supplies. On Thursday, in a memo to employees, UBS said it would match $5 million in donations from employees and clients and would work to expand its network of partners to provide aid with resettlement for displaced families. Jefferies raised $13 million from clients, partners, and employees for charities providing humanitarian aid, it said on Friday. The contributions included $2 million from Michael Bloomberg, former New York City mayor and co-founder of Bloomberg LP. Goldman Sachs pledged $2 million in aid and said it would match employee donations. Delta Air Lines, which has suspended flights to and from Israel until the end of this month, said it will donate $1 million to the American Red Cross. On Friday, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser included Israel in her opening remarks on the bank's earnings call. \"We are a significant bank in the country, and many of our people have lost friends and loved ones,\" Fraser said. \"Others are being called up to serve. Despite all they're dealing with, they are keeping our bank running in the country. And I'm, frankly, in awe of their commitment.\" More broadly, Fraser said, \"the price innocent civilians are paying as this crisis unfolds is absolutely devastating to witness.\" BlackRock CEO Larry Fink also addressed Israel on the company's earnings call. \"There's pretty much universal condemnation of violence with civilian casualties,\" said David Kotok, co-founder of Florida-based investment advisor Cumberland Advisors. He noted that firms have refrained from mentioning specifics, given the political sensitivities of the conflict. \"Once someone ventures into the space of, 'who is the perpetrator and who is the victim,' you enter into the exposure of social media disinformation and risk,\" Kotok said. Bosses at large tech companies have also issued strong statements. Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Antonio Neri said: \"The attack by Hamas on Israeli civilians is unjustified and inexcusable\" and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy called the attacks \"shocking and painful to watch.\" Amazon said it has a contingency plan to keep its AWS cloud service available for customers in Israel. Meta said on Friday it was taking steps including removing praise and substantive support for Hamas from its platforms after the European Union reprimanded social media companies for failing to adequately tackle disinformation. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said it was \"important to call out and stand against antisemitism at this terrible moment\" and condemned \"this historic evil.\" Google has two offices and over 2,000 employees in Israel. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella posted on social media platform X, formerly Twitter, that he was \"heartbroken by the horrific terrorist attacks on Israel,\" where the company has nearly 3,000 employees. Some large companies including Apple and Walmart had yet to issue statements, while some prominent personalities including NBA star LeBron James have spoken out. Supermodel Gigi Hadid, whose father is Palestinian, said on Instagram: \"While I have hopes and dreams for Palestinians, none of them include the harm of a Jewish person.\" (Reporting by Lananh Nguyen in New York and Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Stephen Nellis, Siddharth Cavale, David Gaffen, Arriana McLymore; Writing by Sayantani Ghosh; Editing by David Gregorio)"

        "text": " RENO, Nev. (AP) \u2014 In an ongoing legal battle with the Biden administration over a Nevada lithium mine, environmentalists are poised to return to court with a new approach accusing U.S. wildlife officials of dragging their feet on a year-old petition seeking endangered species status for a tiny snail that lives nearby. The Western Watersheds Project said in its formal notice of intent to sue that the government's failure to list the Kings River pyrg as a threatened or endangered species could push it to the brink of extinction. It says the only place the snail is known to exist is in 13 shallow springs near where Lithium Americas is building its Thacker Pass Mine near the Oregon line. President Joe Biden has made ramped-up domestic production of lithium a key part of his blueprint for a greener future. Worldwide demand for the critical element in the manufacture of electric vehicle batteries is projected to increase six-fold by 2030 compared with 2020. Past lawsuits filed by conservationists and tribes have taken aim \u2014 largely unsuccessfully \u2014 at the Interior Department\u2019s Bureau of Land Management, which they accused of cutting regulatory corners to expedite approval of the mine itself in 2021. The new approach targets the department's Fish and Wildlife Service, charged with ensuring protection of fish and wildlife habitat surrounding the mine site 200 miles (321 kilometers) northeast of Reno. Western Watersheds Project says groundwater pumping associated with the mine\u2019s 370-foot-deep (113-meter) open pit will reduce or eliminate flows to the springs that support the snails. In the formal 90-day notice of intent to sue sent to Interior Secretary Deborah Haaland last month, they say her agency's failure to make a 12-month finding on the listing petition filed in September 2022 is a violation of the Endangered Species Act. \u201cThe Fish and Wildlife Service isn\u2019t supposed to sit on its hands while species are in imminent danger of extinction, but the fact that it hasn\u2019t met the deadlines on the pyrg raises questions about why they might be delaying,\u201d Adam Bronstein, the project's Nevada director, said in a statement. \u201cIt would be absolutely unacceptable if the Biden Administration is waiting until it\u2019s too late to save the species so as not to interrupt the construction of a lithium mine,\" he said. Interior Department spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said in an email Thursday the department had no comment on the group's intent to sue. Western Watersheds Project said time is of the essence because the snails were imperiled even before any new mining was contemplated due to livestock grazing, round-building and, increasingly, the anticipated impacts of climate change. \u201cThe species has no regulatory protection whatsoever ... because it is not an endangered species, or even a Bureau of Land Management-listed Sensitive species, and has no state law protections,\" the notice said. Conservationists and tribal lawyers claimed a partial victory last year when U.S. District Judge Miranda Du concluded the bureau failed to fully comply with new interpretations of the 1872 Mining Law. But she stopped short of blocking the project, allowing construction to begin as the bureau shored up plans for disposal of waste rock. The opponents appealed, but the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Du's ruling in July. The tiny snail\u2019s shell is less than 2 millimeters (0.08 inches) tall. By comparison, a U.S. nickel coin is 1.95 millimeters thick. They've managed to survive in isolated springs, which are remnants of extensive waterways that have covered what is now dry land only to recede many times over the last 2 million years, the listing petition said. The project says three of the springs are within a 1-mile (1.6-kilometer) buffer zone, the bureau established in its review of potential impacts of a 10-foot (3-meter) drawdown of the groundwater table, and the rest are less than 4 miles (4.8 kilometers) away. \"As drought frequency increases with climate change, the Kings River pyrg will be at high risk of extinction,\u201d the letter to Haaland said. It notes that the Nevada Department of Wildlife considers the pyrg \u201cextremely vulnerable to climate change.\u201d Lithium Americas had no comment on the notice of intent to sue the Fish and Wildlife Service, spokesman Tim Crowley said. The company said when the listing petition was filed last year that it's done extensive work to design a project that avoids impacts to the springs. The Bureau of Land Management said earlier its environmental review of the project that it didn't detect any of the snails \"within the direct footprint of the project or any area likely to be adversely affected by the project.\u201d"

Amazon Health Services SVP Neil Lindsay sat down with Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani at the 2023 HLTH Conference to discuss the way the business segment makes healthcare more accessible for patients. \"In healthcare, I've translated that to choice, convenience, and continuity of care. Choice is important because it gives customers agency,\" Lindsay says. \"One of the things in a retail environment, customers do have agency \u2014 they have informed choice. Patients don't always feel like they have agency, don't feel like they have choice. So we need to give them choice. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live. [AUDIO LOGO] - Amazon infiltrating so many aspects of American life. And one area of the tech giant is pushing into further is health care. Our own Anjalee Khemlani sat down with Amazon Health Services Senior Vice President Neil Lindsey at the health conference earlier this week. And she first asked him about the progress the company is making now after struggling previously in the space. NEIL LINDSAY: At Amazon, we're always trying to invent-- to make customers' lives easier, right? Our mission is to be Earth's most customer obsessed company. So that gives us permission to go anywhere if there's an experience that needs improving. And as we all know, unfortunately, there's plenty of opportunity in health care to improve the experience. So we've had our-- we've had various ideas at different points in time. And we learn from all of them. And our focus is very much on how do we make it easier for customers and patients to find, choose, afford, and engage with all of the products, services, and professionals they need to get and stay healthy. That's a pretty big mission. But, you know, we are very focused on how we make it easy to get care, how we make it easy to get medications, and ultimately, how do we make it easier for you to find the things you need to get and stay well. And so that's our mission. And, you know, we have a few efforts going on in that place, as you mentioned. We have One Medical. We have Amazon Pharmacy. We also have a service called Amazon Clinic. So when we think about making it easy to get care, you think about it in two different need states. There's the 40% of people who don't actually have a primary care physician but still need to get care. And it can take two or three weeks, sometimes three or four weeks to get an appointment with a doctor. So Amazon Clinic tries to make that much easier for common conditions, low-acuity conditions for people to be able to access from a selection of providers, either do text or video to either validate what they think they might have or to correct it and then get a treatment. And they can send that, you know, treatment if it's a medication to any pharmacy including Amazon Pharmacy. And then, of course, we want to make sure it's easy for people to get their primary care we all deserve and need, frankly, that care management for ongoing needs. And that's why we have One Medical, which we're excited to make available to more and more people. And then, of course, I mentioned making easy get medications. And that's Amazon Pharmacy. ANJALEE KHEMLANI: And you're growing that, right, from what I understand? NEIL LINDSAY: Well, we're in this to make it easier for customers. And to make it easier for customers, we're going to make it more accessible. And that means growing it also. ANJALEE KHEMLANI: I'm so glad you used the word low acuity because that's a-- NEIL LINDSAY: Yeah. ANJALEE KHEMLANI: --really important way to-- NEIL LINDSAY: Yeah. ANJALEE KHEMLANI: --describe what is going on in this retail big box medicine-- NEIL LINDSAY: OK. ANJALEE KHEMLANI: --space, right? There is a lot of need for more access points, like you said, really getting to the customer where they're at, making it convenient for them to schedule-- NEIL LINDSAY: Absolutely. ANJALEE KHEMLANI: --an appointment. That's the goal. As a millennial-- NEIL LINDSAY: Yeah. ANJALEE KHEMLANI: --I can totally appreciate-- NEIL LINDSAY: Yeah. Yeah. ANJALEE KHEMLANI: --that. But talk to me about how that affects the broader health ecosystem and whether or not conversations are happening where you think about how does that affect tertiary care and the infrastructure they need to kind of-- NEIL LINDSAY: Yeah. ANJALEE KHEMLANI: --stay afloat with charity care and the like. There's a lot that goes on in the health ecosystem. How do you disrupt it but not destroy it? NEIL LINDSAY: Well, our mission is not to disrupt anything. We don't go into anything with the idea that, you know, that's a goal. Our goal is-- ANJALEE KHEMLANI: You should tell everyone that. They're all convinced you're going to disrupt it. NEIL LINDSAY: Well, you know, we don't have a magic wand. We-- you know, we-- what we do is we look at what are the experiences that need to be improved that we can make a difference in. And, you know, what we're good at is connecting the dots, connecting the dots between people as customers and humans to the products and services they need. You do that in a general sense. And in health care, the need is the same, right? We need to connect the dots, remembering also that 60% of everything we sell on Amazon is sold by a third party. ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Right. NEIL LINDSAY: So we don't need to do it all ourselves. You know, we'll do things first party where we believe we can elevate the experience. So Amazon Pharmacy, One Medical, we believe, are elevated experiences, where we can take our expertise and make a difference. You know, when we-- in Amazon, we often talk about selection value and convenience as key to making things easier. In health care, I've translated that to, sort of, choice convenience and continuity of care. That choice is important because it gives customers agency. One of the things that in a retail environment, customers do have agency. They have informed choice. Patients don't always feel like they have agency. They don't feel like they have choice. So we need to give them choice. Secondly is convenience. Convenience is key. Because if it's easy, people will engage. If they engage, they'll get better health outcomes. If they don't, they won't. And the problem is, it's hard to engage right now. If it takes three or four weeks to get an appointment, if you have to line up with 15 other people who are not feeling well at a pharmacy and wait 20 minutes to get your medications, it's not easy. People aren't going to do it. They're just going to get-- not get well. ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Right. NEIL LINDSAY: And it's costing us a fortune as an economy. So-- and then the final point is continuity of care. Ultimately, we all need and deserve that continuity of care that a service like One Medical provides. But to be clear, we-- we're excited by wherever anyone gets their care. There is so much need in health care to make it easier that, you know, we're working hard to do it in whatever way we can. And I celebrate anyone else who is making a difference in making it easier. ANJALEE KHEMLANI: So final question for you. On the pharmacy side, you have a lot of partners that are willing to come. The automatic coupons, for example. NEIL LINDSAY: Yes. ANJALEE KHEMLANI: I know that was a-- NEIL LINDSAY: Yeah. ANJALEE KHEMLANI: --really great idea. But then what about the idea of breaking open that whole system of getting access to medicine, breaking apart the PBM system, breaking apart-- getting the drug manufacturers to sell directly on Amazon. Can that happen? NEIL LINDSAY: Yeah. Well, look, I think one day at a time here, right? Our whole mission, as I said, is-- I think of it this way. If we can make one little thing a bit easier for a lot of people, it will save them a lot of time, a lot of money, and probably some lives. If we can stack up a few more of those, it will save a lot more people, more money, more time, and more lives. And over time, you stack up to what is-- you know, feels like a reinvention. And if you think about Amazon more generally, that's kind of what's happened, right? If our 25-plus-year history, you know, there's not one moment where it was like there was this magical thing, and it all changed. It's over time, we've stacked up these innovations. Some of them small, some of them larger to make life a lot easier and a lot better. And that's what we're trying to do in health care. So, you know, I'm focused more on what can we do next week, next month, and next year to make a difference for customers and patients and members and make their lives better. ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Slowly but surely those, building blocks and learning the system all at one time, right? NEIL LINDSAY: That's right. Well, I guess so too. Yeah, we have a lot of health care expertise in our team. But it's new to us as Amazon. And we know that. We know that we have to come at this with a lot of humility and learn from a lot of folks. And we learn from our own experiments as well. But, you know, there's a lot of opportunity to make a difference in people's lives. And we're excited to be doing it. ANJALEE KHEMLANI: We'll have to leave it there, Neil Lindsay. NEIL LINDSAY: Thank you very much. ANJALEE KHEMLANI: SVP of Amazon Health Services. NEIL LINDSAY: Great-- ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Thank you for joining us. NEIL LINDSAY: Thank you to you too."

        "text": " WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Singapore's deputy prime minister said on Friday he hopes for substantial progress in the U.S.-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) discussions in time for next month's Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. \"We are working on how we can add substance to the different pillars of IPEF ... We hope there will be something to announce by the time of the APEC summit,\" Lawrence Wong told Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies after talks with U.S. officials this week. \"In areas like supply chains, green economy, digital economy; these are things that we are pursuing, and we hope certainly that there can be some substantial progress.\" U.S. President Joe Biden launched IPEF as part of efforts to step up economic engagement with Asia to compete with China after his predecessor, Donald Trump, pulled out of a pan-Pacific trade pact, but it lacks the market-access provisions Asian states want. Wong, who is also Singapore's finance minister, said that given it may be difficult in some instances to get consensus among all 14 IPEF members, Singapore had said its bilateral cooperation with the United States could be a \"pathfinder\" for others to follow. \"We set high standards, it can be a pathfinder, it can be a test-bed that we do together before it is expanded to the broader region,\" he said. Sources familiar with plans for IPEF discussions at APEC say there is hope countries could agree to language around the third and fourth pillars of the framework, which deal with clean energy and decarbonization as well as anti-corruption. The first pillar on trade could prove too far a bridge for a November consensus, they say, and talks on the second pillar, involving supply chains, were largely agreed in May. The summit meetings of the 21-member APEC forum will take place in the week of Nov. 11-17 in San Francisco. Wong said Singapore would like to see more far-reaching agreements with the United States, including market access and trade liberalization, but recognized \"there's no mood to talk about these issues\" at the moment in the U.S. given its domestic political environment. \"But I think we should maintain high ambition and hopefully down the road, in years to come, the conditions may change.\" (Reporting by David Brunnstrom; additional reporting by Michael Martina; Editing by Sandra Maler)"

(AP) \u2014 A ban on electronic skill games in Virgnia went back into effect Friday after the state Supreme Court vacated an injunction that allowed thousands of the betting machines to remain in gas stations, bars and conveniece stores. The injunction was issued by a lower court in an ongoing lawsuit that argues the ban is a violation of free speech. But a panel of three Supreme Court justices found that the suit is unlikely to succeed. \u201cAlthough at times it is difficult to determine where a particular activity falls on the speech/conduct continuum, no such difficulty is present when the activity being regulated is gambling. We long have viewed gambling as conduct that may be heavily regulated and even banned by the Commonwealth as an exercise of its police powers,\" the panel wrote in its order. The games look and play like slot machines, though manufacturers say there is an element of skill involved. The General Assembly passed legislation outlawing skill games in 2020, but former Gov. Ralph Northam delayed it for a year to help the state raise money for COVID-19 relief efforts. The ban then took effect in 2021, but the lawsuit resulted in an injunction that allowed games already registered with the state's Alcoholic Beverage Control Authoirty to continue until the issue is resolved. The lawsuit is now set to go to trial in December."

In the complaint, a regional director of the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) accused X \u2014 formerly known as Twitter \u2014 of violating the federal law that prohibits punishing employees for communicating and organizing with others about their working conditions. X did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The NLRB said the dispute began on Nov. 10, 2022, after Musk ordered workers back to the office last November and reportedly said \"if you can physically make it to an office and you don't show up, resignation accepted\". Employee Yao Yue responded with a post on Twitter telling fellow workers, \"Don't resign, let him fire you.\" A few days later, she was terminated in violation of the National Labor Relations Act, according to the complaint. Musk completed his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter last October and began his ownership with a round of firings, including top executives, laying off more than half of its workforce as a cost-cutting measure. The company is facing a series of lawsuits stemming from the layoffs, including claims that it targeted women and workers with disabilities and that it failed to pay promised severance to laid off employees. The company has denied wrongdoing in the cases in which it has filed responses.

The G-7 trade ministers meeting in Osaka runs Oct. 28-29. The proposal is part of EU\u2019s efforts to secure deals with likeminded partners to diversify its access to critical materials. It also aims to cement alliances in the face of global challenges, including climate change and China\u2019s assertive rise. Farrell walked away from negotiations on free-trade accord in Brussels in July, surprising his European hosts. The Australian minister said at the time the EU wasn\u2019t offering enough concessions on export quotas for Australian agricultural products, including beef, mutton and sugar. Talks between Australia and the EU on a deal have been taking place for more than five years. The EU is Australia\u2019s third-largest trading partner, as a bloc, and its second-largest source of foreign investment. Osaka could be the last chance for a breakthrough between Australian and the EU, at least until late next year, due to election cycles in Europe, people familiar with the matter said. \u201cConcluding this FTA will open up trade opportunities with an important partner, thereby strengthening EU supply chains,\u201d Gill said. Both Australia and the EU have struck broad agreement across a range of elements on the FTA, but the final negotiations have proved difficult. Australia wants greater quotas for its agricultural exports to the EU, while Europe is pressing hard for the removal of geographical indicators on products such as brie and prosecco. Both sides were cautious on the likelihood of striking a deal, with Farrell telling Bloomberg he would need to see a new offer from his European counterparts. \u201cOur position hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Farrell said in a statement. \u201cTo conclude a deal, Australia needs new commercially meaningful agricultural access for a range of products into European markets.\u201d Some business groups are keen for a deal to be struck, with BusinessEurope and the European Australian Business Council issuing a joint letter on Oct. 9 calling for agreement. \u201cThe window of opportunity under the current mandate of the von der Leyen Commission is rapidly closing,\u201d the letter said, referring to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. --With assistance from Alberto Nardelli and Garfield Reynolds.

JULIE HYMAN: What's the timeline then for the product? And then not just for you guys to deliver, but I'm curious where you think what the longer term potential is for adoption of these vehicles? DORON MERDINGER: So I'll start with the second question. I think the long term is just infinite. This machine can be used for endless use cases. It can rescue people. You can go and play [AUDIO OUT] on a yacht. You can use it for first responders. You can use it for just travel or other industries. We expect to start delivering the first units 2025. This is the first couple of units that we are-- this is already pre-ordered, and then scale up production from there. - And, Doron, what has been the response of regulators? DORON MERDINGER: So it's interesting. It's hard to say, but the thing is that the United States, the FAA, is really behind China and Europe and South America as far as the eVTOLs. We are doing a personal eVTOL. And there's new advances in this regarding [INAUDIBLE] for personal use and LSA. So the US, the FAA started picking up. We are working with them. We're advising them as well. We're part of the groups over there. And it feels that it fits into our certification or the process of development. The certification path basically is there. We expect the-- JULIE HYMAN: Doron, there aren't-- oh, sorry. There are a couple of other companies that are also in the eVTOL space. Going forward, what do you think is going to be-- how is the competitive landscape look to you? And how does Doroni going to distinguish itself from some of the others? DORON MERDINGER: Well, most of the eVTOLs are targeting an air taxi. So this is different type of use cases. The certification more complicated in what we do. It's not for everybody [AUDIO OUT] personal use. The machine that we're doing is for sale is not a ridesharing one. So more affordable, we're talking about $300,000 to $400,000 vehicle compared to 15 million. We believe that what we have as we are the front part of it, the most novel advanced technology as we are the first ones to fly manned in the US with such a personal aircraft inside this facility, as you probably see. We're doing well. We're very comfortable with where we are. And the sky's the limit here as far as what can you use this technology for. It's amazing. We believe the world is about to change once we come up with the product, which is certified. And in fact, what you see behind me is already a full-scale one that we're flying. And it's-- it'll be the same measurements. So it's now-- we're creating now the product, the go-to-market product, which is-- which will be on the same basis, but will be all the certification and basically the intact airframe."

The central bank was forced from the sidelines and raised its policy interest rate by 15 percentage points to 133% in response. Even amid the increasing threat of hyperinflation, Argentina has shown little willingness for anything more than incremental reform. But \u201cthe situation demands much faster actions,\u201d Rodrigo Valdes, the fund\u2019s western hemisphere director, said Friday in an interview. Frontrunner Javier Milei, a Libertarian economist, is vowing to scrap both Argentina\u2019s peso and its central bank. Valdes warned that his plan to dollarize the economy will require tough reforms, like a flexible labor market, to ensure stability. \u201cWe will try to discuss the conditions needed in the long run for a regime to work well, because you lose foreign exchange as an adjuster,\u201d the IMF official said in Morocco during the annual meetings of the fund and the World Bank Group. \u201cDuring the transition you need to stabilize reserves \u2014 many things need to be worked out.\u201d Read more: IMF\u2019s $43 Billion Argentina Problem Is About to Get Worse Elsewhere in Latin America, however, central banks have the \u201cluxury\u201d of continuing to ease monetary policy even amid increasing global risks and the impact of higher Treasury yields, Valdes said. The region\u2019s \u201ctimely\u201d hiking cycle makes it \u201cthe best prepared in the world\u201d to keep lowering interest rates, even in the face of a potential jump in energy prices amid the Israel-Hamas war, he added. Major regional economies like Brazil, Chile and Peru have been lowering rates over the past few months, as price pressures eased following aggressive tightening cycles in the wake of the Covid pandemic. Valdes flagged outperformance by Brazil and Mexico as the reason the IMF\u2019s growth estimates for the region were below actual results over the past few years. \u201cForecasting is always difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth have tight monetary policy and the reforms made in the last few years started to accumulate and produce results.\u201d The fund sees growth averaging 2.3% across Latin America this year. Excluding Argentina and Venezuela, it forecasts regional inflation will slow to 5% in 2023 before easing to 3.6% next year. Central bankers across the region have warned about the impact on price pressures from the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon. To the fund, the climate phenomenon could negatively impact activity with floods in Ecuador and Peru, droughts in Colombia, Central America and southern Peru. Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, however, might benefit from a an increase in rains after a severe water crisis. \u201cDespite a generally timely withdrawal of the pandemic fiscal support, public debt remains high and is projected to remain above that of their peers by 2028,\u201d the fund warned in its regional report. Fiscal consolidation and structural economic reforms that boost growth are the main challenges ahead. Valdes also said an IMF agreement with El Salvador, which has been negotiating with the fund for years, is getting closer to the finish line.

Long-struggling SAS, ravaged by the pandemic and pressured by low-cost rivals, sought bankruptcy protection last year. SAS announced last week that Air France-KLM and U.S. investment firm Castlelake would become new major shareholders alongside the Danish state. Apollo, which last year granted SAS a $700 million debtor-in-possession (DIP) loan to fund its restructuring, had been seen as a likely winner in the bidding round by the airline to raise equity as part of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan. Apollo could convert the loan into equity at the end of the process. \"Apollo is still an active bidder,\" the source said, adding that the U.S. company was seeking to inject additional cash into SAS on top of what the winning consortium said it would invest. It was unclear how big a stake Apollo would seek or how much it would invest. Total investments by new shareholders, which also include Danish investment firm Lind Invest, in the reorganized SAS would amount to 12.9 billion Swedish crowns ($1.18 billion). SAS, Castlelake, Air France-KLM and Apollo all declined to comment. The Danish finance ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

JOSH LIPTON: And global regulators are in a race to get a handle on artificial intelligence, but building laws that protect citizens from the risks while encouraging innovation is a hard balance to strike for sure. EU has taken the lead here, as it has on other tech focused regulation, creating an AI-specific law banning certain technology, like facial recognition and enforcing that generative AI systems like ChatGPT have to be reviewed before commercial release. The US is further behind, as lawmakers still seek input on regulation in the White House unveiled its blueprint on AI. So with rules coming, what can you expect? Joining us now is Credo AI, Navrina Singh. Navrina, let's start there with regulation because the EU does have this proposed law to regulate AI. You're very involved in this sector. You know a lot of the players, Navrina. How are the companies thinking about navigating that new law? NAVRINA SINGH: Thank you so much for having me, Josh. Credo AI is a leading authority on AI governance, risk management, and compliance. So since our founding, we've been extremely focused on making sure that AI is always in service of humanity. So as you can imagine, with these upcoming regulations-- and I do want to specify that EU AI Act is still not passed. It's being debated. And we are looking to the European Commission to pass that end of this year. So with this impending law, you can imagine these companies right now are making sure that they have the foundational pieces in place, whether it is assessing risk management frameworks within the organizations or making sure that they have a handle on where they are actually using AI versus not using AI. So a long road ahead, but I'm excited to see the work that enterprises are already putting in place. JOSH LIPTON: Navrina, one criticism I've read about the EU law-- and I'd love to get your take on it-- is that some are saying it kind of benefits those companies who have the money, the cash, the resources to cover the costs of compliance while disadvantaging the smaller players. Do you agree with that criticism? Is it fair? NAVRINA SINGH: Josh, with any regulation, the narrative that we've always held in the marketplace is regulations and compliance is cumbersome. And I think this is the moment in time, especially for artificial intelligence, we all have an opportunity to change that narrative. With EU AI Act, yes, absolutely, there's a lot of critical requirements around transparency, risk management, making sure that you're actually registering AI applications in Europe. But as you can imagine, companies like Credo AI are existing to actually make it less burdensome and change compliance to a competitive advantage, especially for SMPs and startups. And then that is a critical focus for us here at Credo AI because in this age of artificial intelligence, companies that embrace governance are going to actually emerge as leaders."

The ruling was made by just three of the judges on the court and the regulator could have sought a review by a full slate of judges. The agency is not planning any other appeals in the case, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing the ongoing matter. Grayscale has said that investors would benefit from conversion to an ETF, as shares could be easily created and redeemed. The current closed-end structure doesn\u2019t let investors redeem shares when prices decline, leading to trading at steep discounts relative to the underlying Bitcoin. The August decision was heralded by crypto advocates as a watershed moment for the industry, and a rebuke of the SEC\u2019s stance under Chair Gary Gensler. In that ruling, Judge Neomi Rao said the denial of Grayscale\u2019s proposal was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d because the regulator hadn\u2019t explained its rationale.

        "text": " By Lananh Nguyen and Aditya Soni (Reuters) -As big U.S. corporations kicked off corporate earnings season this week, executives addressed the Israel-Hamas conflict and some companies launched fundraising efforts. \"I just want to say how deeply saddened that we all are about the recent horrific attacks on Israel ... Terrorism and hatred have no place in our civilized world,\" JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said on a post-earnings call before diving into results. He warned that the war in Ukraine, compounded by the attacks on Israel, could have \"far-reaching impacts on energy and food markets, global trade, and geopolitical relationships.\" On Thursday, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said: \"As the days have passed, the scope of the atrocities carried out against Israel and its citizens have become clearer and more horrific. It is not enough to condemn terrorism and the intentional targeting of civilians - we ourselves must take action.\" Fundraising efforts to relieve the crisis have been mobilized swiftly. Billionaires and members of the U.S. and Canadian Jewish community have contributed millions of dollars, military gear and clothing, and food and household supplies. On Thursday, in a memo to employees, UBS said it would match $5 million in donations from employees and clients and would work to expand its network of partners to provide aid with resettlement for displaced families. Jefferies raised $13 million from clients, partners, and employees for charities providing humanitarian aid, it said on Friday. The contributions included $2 million from Michael Bloomberg, former New York City mayor and co-founder of Bloomberg LP. Goldman Sachs pledged $2 million in aid and said it would match employee donations. Delta Air Lines, which has suspended flights to and from Israel until the end of this month, said it will donate $1 million to the American Red Cross. On Friday, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser included Israel in her opening remarks on the bank's earnings call. \"We are a significant bank in the country, and many of our people have lost friends and loved ones,\" Fraser said. \"Others are being called up to serve. Despite all they're dealing with, they are keeping our bank running in the country. And I'm, frankly, in awe of their commitment.\" More broadly, Fraser said, \"the price innocent civilians are paying as this crisis unfolds is absolutely devastating to witness.\" BlackRock CEO Larry Fink also addressed Israel on the company's earnings call. \"There's pretty much universal condemnation of violence with civilian casualties,\" said David Kotok, co-founder of Florida-based investment advisor Cumberland Advisors. He noted that firms have refrained from mentioning specifics, given the political sensitivities of the conflict. \"Once someone ventures into the space of, 'who is the perpetrator and who is the victim,' you enter into the exposure of social media disinformation and risk,\" Kotok said. Bosses at large tech companies have also issued strong statements. Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Antonio Neri said: \"The attack by Hamas on Israeli civilians is unjustified and inexcusable\" and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy called the attacks \"shocking and painful to watch.\" Amazon said it has a contingency plan to keep its AWS cloud service available for customers in Israel. Meta said on Friday it was taking steps including removing praise and substantive support for Hamas from its platforms after the European Union reprimanded social media companies for failing to adequately tackle disinformation. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said it was \"important to call out and stand against antisemitism at this terrible moment\" and condemned \"this historic evil.\" Google has two offices and over 2,000 employees in Israel. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella posted on social media platform X, formerly Twitter, that he was \"heartbroken by the horrific terrorist attacks on Israel,\" where the company has nearly 3,000 employees. Some large companies including Apple and Walmart had yet to issue statements, while some prominent personalities including NBA star LeBron James have spoken out. Supermodel Gigi Hadid, whose father is Palestinian, said on Instagram: \"While I have hopes and dreams for Palestinians, none of them include the harm of a Jewish person.\" (Reporting by Lananh Nguyen in New York and Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Stephen Nellis, Siddharth Cavale, David Gaffen, Arriana McLymore; Writing by Sayantani Ghosh; Editing by David Gregorio)"

But it hasn't always been a smooth ride, as General Motors (GM), Ford (F), and Stellantis (STLA) are deadlocked with the United Auto Workers (UAW) over the future of manufacturing amid this transition. Yahoo Finance spoke to experts across the industry to give investors an inside look at the state of the EV industry as part of the weekly series \"EVs: The Road Ahead.\" EV prices dropped for many manufacturers, including Tesla (TSLA), in Q3. Cox Automotive Director of Industry Insights Stephanie Valdez-Streaty remains positive regarding EV pricing. Valdez-Streaty said, \"Consumer sentiment is changing in terms of affordability, so I think that's really going to help.\" Craig Irwin, ROTH Capital Partners Senior Research Analyst, and Ronald Jewsikow, Guggenheim Securities Vice President \u2013 Automotive Equity Research, broke down the investments in EVs and why demand remains low. Irwin explained, \"To build the EV charging infrastructure out there, we probably need another $10-20 billion on top of the $7.5 (billion) that's been set aside.\" Jewsikow added some insight with regard to the EV truck market. He said, \"What we've seen so far, at least with the early entrants into the EV pickup market, there's been a strong preference for the gasoline-powered options.\" Blink Charging (BLNK) President and CEO Brendan Jones and Plug In America Executive Director Joel Levin discussed the most important challenges behind the EV charging infrastructure. Jones believes that consumers need to break the trend of fueling at a station rather than using reliable home chargers. He explained, \"We have to break the dominant paradigm of charging by saying, you don't have to go to a depot or fuel station.\" Levin believes that there needs to be more effort put into the installation of EV charging stations at apartment complexes. He said, \"It's not a simple problem. It's probably the single most challenging problem we have in the EV space.\" According to a poll from Ipsos and Yahoo Finance, 57 percent of respondents answered that they are not likely to purchase an electric vehicle as their next car. Yahoo Finance Senior Autos Reporter Pras Subramanian believes that \"education is key\" to the adoption of EVs \"if the country is going to see the Biden administration's 50 percent mandate of EVs by 2030.\" Christine Tezak, ClearView Energy Partners, LLC Managing Director of Research, detailed the challenges of the grid and why it could hold back the EV infrastructure rollout. Tezak explained, \"High intensity fast-paced chargers. Those are like little industrial facilities and accommodating them on the grid is going to be a little trickier.\" Zero Emission Transportation Association (ZETA) Executive Director Albert Gore III broke down the EV tax credits and why they could be significant for wide EV adoption. Gore III said, \"A lot of work still to be done, but the pace is really accelerating very quickly.\" GreenPower Motor Company (GP) CEO & Chairman Fraser Atkinson detailed the growing trend of states adopting zero-emission mandates for school buses and the infrastructure required to meet those mandates. Atkinson said, \"Coming in with electric vehicles where we need to install a lot of charging stations has a significant impact on the ability of school districts to electrify in certain locations.\" Doron Merdinger, Doroni Aerospace CEO and Founder, discussed the future of EVs with its flying vehicles. The company completed its first manned test flight in July. Merdinger said, \"The long term is just infinite. This machine can be used for endless use cases ... this is the first couple of units already preordered, and then scale up production from there.\" Video highlights: 00:00:04 - Cox Automotive Director of Industry Insights Stephanie Valdez-Streaty 00:00:14 - ROTH Capital Partners Senior Research Analyst Craig Irwin 00:00:27 - Ronald Jewsikow, Guggenheim Securities Vice President \u2013 Automotive Equity Research 00:00:41 - Blink Charging President and CEO Brendan Jones 00:00:52 - Plug In America Executive Director Joel Levin 00:01:04 - Yahoo Finance Senior Autos Reporter Pras Subramanian 00:01:23 - Christine Tezak, ClearView Energy Partners, LLC Managing Director of Research, 00:01:34 - Zero Emission Transportation Association Executive Director Albert Gore III 00:01:49 - GreenPower Motor Company CEO & Chairman Fraser Atkinson 00:02:07 - Doroni Aerospace CEO and Founder Doron Merdinger Watch all of Yahoo Finance's special coverage \"EVs: The Road Ahead.\""

The District of Columbia Court of Appeals in Washington in August ruled that the SEC was wrong to reject Grayscale's proposed bitcoin ETF, in a case that has been closely watched by the industry which has been trying for a decade to advance such products. The SEC's decision not to appeal likely paves the way for the agency to review Grayscale's application. A spokeswoman for Grayscale did not immediately provide comment. A spot bitcoin ETF would give investors exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization without having to own it. The SEC has denied all spot bitcoin ETF applications, including Grayscale's, on the grounds applicants have not shown they can protect investors from market manipulation. Grayscale sued the SEC, arguing that because the agency previously approved certain surveillance agreements to prevent fraud in bitcoin futures-based ETFs the same setup should be satisfactory for Grayscale's spot ETF, since both spot and futures funds rely on bitcoin's price. The appeals court ruled that the SEC arbitrarily denied Grayscale's application because it never explained why the two arrangements were materially different. The appeals court is expected to issue a mandate specifying how its decision should be executed, which will likely include instructing the SEC to revisit Grayscale's application. Several other asset managers, including BlackRock, Fidelity and Invesco, have similar filings pending with the SEC for a spot bitcoin ETF. The SEC is due to decide on those applications by next year at the latest. The SEC's press office did not immediately provide comment.

        "text": " By Dietrich Knauth NEW YORK, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Prima, a private-equity backed farmer that is the largest producer of peaches and other stone fruit in North America, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Delaware on Friday. The company, owned by private equity firm Paine Schwartz Partners, has about $679 million in debt, and plans to sell its business in bankruptcy, according to bankruptcy court documents. Prima farms peaches, nectarines, plums and apricots on its 18,000 acres (7,284 hectares) of farmland in California's San Joaquin Valley. Prima has struggled under its high debt load, and it has also faced significant setbacks since 2020, including a salmonella outbreak that led to a recall of peaches in the U.S. and the 2020 Creek Fire in California, which damaged orchards and reduced crop yields and quality. Prima will try to find a buyer for its assets by November, hoping to avoid an upcoming cash crunch between its profitable harvest seasons. Prima has about $26 million in cash, and it could run out of money by January 2024 if it doesn't find a buyer before next year's harvest season begins in May, according to court documents. If no buyer emerges, Prima will pivot to a debt restructuring or a liquidation of its business, according to court documents. The company was formed from a 2019 merger of Gerawan Farming Inc. and Wawona Packing Company. The company had over $300 million in sales revenue in 2022, with 60% of that coming from sale of peaches, according to court documents. (Reporting by Dietrich Knauth; Editing by Sandra Maler)"

Bank executives, however, remain wary as the Federal Reserve may implement new capital requirements for banks, leaving potential investors hesitant. Whalen Global Advisors LLC Chairman R.C. Whalen joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the capital requirements and what investors need to pay attention to. Whalen explains why the Federal Reserve is under pressure to make these changes: \" The regulators have reacted to what occurred in the first quarter [of 2023], when we had several banks fail, so they're catching up. They are under attack by not just the banks but by everyone in the housing industry because a lot of the changes are going to make are going to make mortgages more expensive for consumers.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live. JULIE HYMAN: Let's talk more about bank earnings now. Bank earnings kicking off with a bang today, with strong results out of JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup. JPMorgan seeing profits jump by 35% from the same quarter last year. Wells Fargo beat estimates, raising its annual forecast and benefiting from a rising rate environment. Could the bounce last? We shall see, especially as bank executives are warning about new capital requirements. Should investors be concerned about that as well? Joining us now, Chris Whalen, of Whalen Global Advisors. Chris, it's great to see you. And I actually want to start there with these new capital requirements, which the banks are sounding the alarm on. How onerous are they going to be? And is this a reason for investors to not own the banks? CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: It's not going to help, Julie. The regulators have reacted to what occurred in the first quarter when we had several banks fail. So they're catching up. They are under attack by not just the banks, but by everyone in the housing industry because a lot of the changes they're going to make are going to make mortgages more expensive for consumers. So I think we'll see. I'm not sure that this thing is baked yet. Let's put it that way. - And, Chris, what about loan loss provisions in terms of what they set aside this quarter versus last quarter? I'm just interested what you heard today and what do you make of those trends? CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: Well, here's the thing. The narrative that you're hearing from the banks is that they beat on earnings as a net interest income. But that's only if you compare them to last year. If you look at them sequentially, they're down. Jamie Dimon, at JPMorgan, is really the only exception to this. So the big headline for earnings this quarter for me is lower provisions. Almost all of the banks had lower provisions than last quarter. They've already been putting aside for the industry about 20 billion a quarter. And losses aren't even half that. So they don't really have to put more aside. And the key here is that this is not a consumer recession. We have this silent institutional commercial real estate recession. And you have the banks under a lot of pressure because of interest rates. But the consumer hasn't rolled over yet. You don't see it in defaults and credit cards and autos. So a lot of people have been predicting the end of the world. But you just don't see it in earnings. I think they're a year early, to be honest with you. And the big issue for the banks is loans. They've got to go find the assets. You're not seeing a lot of lending right now because rates are so high. And the traditional sources of new assets, new loans, both commercial and residential, are just not doing much business right now. We're not even going to do a trillion dollars in new mortgage loans this year. Commercial is also very quiet because nobody knows how to value these assets. That's the big issue. If we see another bank roll over this quarter or in the fourth quarter, the FDIC is not going to be able to sell them because rates are still rising. It's hard to sell assets if you don't know what they're worth."

        "text": " Shares of the Progressive Corporation (PGR) jump after the insurance provider reported strong third-quarter earnings. Progressive cites pricing improvements and profitability gains that boosted its latest results. Gold futures (GC=F) trend upward, coming off their best week since March. Prices rose as geopolitical tensions like the Israel-Hamas conflict increased demand for safe haven assets. Uncertainty pushed investors toward gold, while heightened volatility expanded options trading. AMC Entertainment (AMC) stock closes lower Friday, dropping after the movie theater chain reported lower-than-expected box office revenue for the opening of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour concert film. AMC had moved up the release date by one day due to high demand, which may have impacted their ability to fully capitalize on marketing and promotions for the event. Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton break down the details of today's trending tickers. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live. JULIE HYMAN: Looking at some of the other individual movers that we are watching on the day that we haven't yet talked about, Progressive, those shares at a record high on the day, up 8%. And that's after the company reported strong September and third quarter results here. And it looked like underwriting profitability was improving, and the company's pricing also improving. So that helping the numbers. - Yeah, last time they reported, remember, over the summer, not such a great reaction, not such a great response. But this today, that was a sharp move higher, up over 8% in today's trade. I know Jefferies, for example, liked what they see. Strong year-over-year and month-over-month improvement in underlying results is what they were telling their clients. So nice move today. And that stock up about 20% now so far this year. JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and one of the other measures you look at with insurers is called the combined ratio. You look at it for health insurers too. It basically looks at losses and expenses against the premiums that they have brought in. And it was 89.7%. So a lower number is good because you want to not be spending everything on all of the premiums that are coming in. You want to keep on to some of them. So that is down quite a bit from the 97% in August. So a big improvement, in other words, in that measure of Progressive's results. - All right, from insurer to the yellow metal. Let's talk gold, having its best week since March, by the way. Prices rising this week amid the Israel-Hamas war. Investors pushing into the space as a safe haven amid this conflict. So makes sense, Julie, right? When there is war, there's tension, there's conflict, there is a lot of uncertainty. We were just discussing about whether that conflict broadens with a ground offensive by Israel. Does it drag in Hezbollah? Does it drag in Iran? Just lots of uncertainty. In addition, what that, of course, would mean for oil, the energy markets. When people feel that kind of nervousness, they feel that kind of uncertainty, they look to safe havens. And of course, gold would be one of your go-to moves there. JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and it's a switch for gold, which had been going back towards 1,800, as we just showed on that chart. And now going up back to the 1,900 level, which is a level that we haven't seen in a little while here. There's that chart that we've seen for the year. So interesting that it dipped down to 18 and then made a pretty rapid move, especially when you consider that gold does not always make that kind of a rapid move. So interesting to see that there. We're also seeing a surge in options trading on the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, GLD, right? Implied volatility for options also up the most since March. So another measure, effectively, of interest there. By the way, the move that is happening in gold is not just happening in gold, of course. You're seeing it in other asset classes too, where investors are looking for safety. You could argue that utilities, which is viewed as a defensive sector, the part of the move there is spurred by that. And then also, the move down in yields that we have seen a little bit this week is because people are buying treasuries, which, again, are seen as, on a relative basis, a safer investment. - And reports noting with that move in gold, by the way, you are breaking through some key technical levels as well. So one to keep an eye on. JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, definitely. One more stock that we are watching, AMC. After getting a little bit of a pop yesterday, plummeting today by about 14%. Trying to figure out exactly what's going on here. Could be the Taylor Swift Eras Tour movie, which brought in $2.8 million at the box office for Thursday previews. It sounds like a big number. It was below the estimate of $5 million. But it seems like it mostly has to do with timing. Swift moved up unexpectedly the timeline of the movie's release, which could have limited marketing and ticket sales because people didn't have a lot of time to then get tickets and react when she moved up the release time, so. - I'm also impressed just by the bold icon move like a Taylor Swift who-- I'm reading through these reports, Julie-- she negotiated directly with AMC. So she bypassed the Hollywood studios in the distribution deal, which means she skips the distribution fees, which means maybe even more lucrative for her. JULIE HYMAN: You know what always cracks me up? - Yeah? JULIE HYMAN: Do you think Taylor Swift herself was sitting down and doing these negotiations? - I don't know. JULIE HYMAN: Like, we always use Taylor Swift as shorthand. But, like, how many people does she have working for her? She's got-- - I would assume it's a machine. JULIE HYMAN: She made-- she made a good choice in whoever she's hired to do this kind of work. - You're saying she's not at the table right now just making these deals with Adam Aron? You don't think so? JULIE HYMAN: Maybe. - Who am I to say? I don't know. JULIE HYMAN: I don't know. But I don't think the assumption is that she is, right? Like you said, it's a machine around these stars. - Taylor-- I'm giving Taylor the benefit of the doubt. Who knows? Maybe she's got the whole thing plugged in. JULIE HYMAN: Sure, let's give her benefit of the doubt. Oh, so many people do."

The appeals court is expected to issue a mandate specifying how its decision should be executed, which will likely include instructing the SEC to revisit Grayscale's application. Several other asset managers, including BlackRock, Fidelity and Invesco, have similar filings pending with the SEC for a spot bitcoin ETF. The SEC is due to decide on those applications by next year at the latest. The SEC's press office did not immediately provide comment.

        "text": " Healthcare union workers reach a tentative deal with Kaiser Permanente after three days of striking. UNC Health and health insurance company UnitedHealthcare (UNH) have started contract negotiations as their contract expires on April 1, 2024. Yahoo Finance Health Reporter Anjalee Khemlani discusses the latest news in the healthcare sector. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live. - Tentative deal with Kaiser Permanente has been reached this morning. And given the current environment, a deal between the opposing sides after only three days of walkouts is pretty surprising. But the disruptions were extensive given how many areas of health care were impacted. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani to give us the details. Anjalee. ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right. Looking to hear this deal, or tentative agreement, now before another strike in November that was planned by these union workers. So let's take a look at what the tentative deal includes. That includes a pay raise, about $23 for minimum wage for workers in other states, 25 in California. 21% wage increase in the next four years, increases in the performance sharing plan, and investments from Kaiser in job training and dealing with those staffing shortages that have been really the crux of the issue, including that cancelation of the November strike, and all of this to go in effect, if ratified, by those workers about 80,000 of those by October 18. And it would be back-- backdated to October 1. Now, this has really impacted a large swath of the country. We know Kaiser is one of the largest health systems. And it has affected four states in total, about 75,000 workers impacted. And it's caused delays in things like surgeries, chemotherapy. Non-urgent care has been largely impacted in some of the same ways that if you recall during the pandemic. There were delays for non-urgent care. So that's something that has been averted by this potential deal. And we'll have to keep an eye on it. As we know, labor shortages are a very big issue today for hospitals and health systems. - And Anjalee, hospital insurer contract negotiations are being widely reported this year. What's going on there? ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right. To my point just now about Kaiser, I mean, great news on the front of getting this deal in place. But if it were any other hospital system, they would then have to turn around and get that money for these increases form somewhere. And that somewhere is the payer. So the insurers. And so we're seeing that friction of what the hospital needs are around the country to continue to operate while also looking at what has happened post pandemic. During the pandemic, hospitals had to, like I mentioned before, really be fixed and create ways to work around the unprecedented demand on their systems. They got federal dollars in for some of the work they were doing. But with that gone away, they're faced with trying to balance out their balance sheets, essentially. They need to look at a way to make their hospital run efficiently, economically, and not run out of money, and maintain margins. So that's something that they're now fighting with insurers to increase their commercial rates, looking at ways with changes in some of the state laws, and federal laws, and payment models. A lot of stuff coming down on these health systems, and putting pressure on their revenues. And so how this all pans out with all of these negotiations going on is going to be something we'll have to take a look at definitely by the end of the year to see how many hospitals end up out of network, or how many contracts end up falling through. It's something that could potentially impact some specialties, or certain areas of the country, more than others. So we'll definitely have to keep an eye on that JULIE HYMAN: Yes we will. Thanks so much, Anjalee. Really interesting stuff."

        "text": " By Praveen Menon SYDNEY, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Australians began voting on Saturday in a historic referendum, the first in almost a quarter of a century, to decide whether to recognise its First Peoples in the constitution, as requested by the country's Indigenous leaders six years ago. Australians will simply write \"Yes\" or \"No\" on the ballot paper, after a question asking whether they agree to alter the 122-year-old constitution to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people, and create an Indigenous body, called the Voice to Parliament, that can provide advice to the government on Indigenous issues. Doors to polling booths open at 8 a.m. (from 2100 GMT on Friday in Sydney and Melbourne to 2400 GMT in Perth), although more than 5 million people have already voted at early polling centres, overseas, or through postal votes. Voting is compulsory in Australia. Counting of the votes will begin after polls close at 6 p.m. (0700 GMT in Sydney), and the Australian Electoral Commission will release updated tallies as they come in from voting centres. The Voice to Parliament was proposed in the Uluru Statement from the Heart, a 2017 document that set out a roadmap for Indigenous reconciliation with wider Australia. Supporters of the proposal believe entrenching an Indigenous Voice into the constitution would unite Australia and usher in a new era with its Indigenous people, who account for 3.8% of the population and by most socio-economic measures are the most disadvantaged people in the country. They have inhabited the land for about 60,000 years but are not mentioned in the constitution, while data ranging from life expectancy to suicide rates to average income shows them worse off than non-Indigenous people. Public debate over the referendum, however, steadily shifted to divisive issues such as race, privilege and who gets what, with detractors arguing that the Voice would give special rights to Aboriginal people in the founding document. Online misinformation gained traction and a lacklustre campaign in support of \"Yes\" failed to inspire. The latest polling trends indicate the \"No\" vote is likely to succeed, which academics and human rights advocates fear could set back reconciliation efforts by years. Referendums are difficult to pass in Australia, with only eight of 44 referendums succeeding since the country's founding in 1901. Constitutional change requires a majority of votes both nationwide and in at least four of the six states. The Voice has been a key feature of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's term in office, and a referendum loss would stand out, political analysts say, as his biggest setback since coming to power in May last year.

        "text": " By Michael Erman (Reuters) -Pfizer on Friday slashed its full-year revenue forecast by 13% and said it will cut $3.5 billion worth of jobs and expenses due to lower-than-expected sales of its COVID-19 vaccine and treatment. Pfizer earned record revenue in 2021 and 2022, topping $100 billion last year, after developing its vaccine Comirnaty with German partner BioNTech SE and antiviral treatment Paxlovid on its own. Last year, revenue from those two products exceeded $56 billion. But annual vaccination rates have dropped sharply since 2021 and demand for treatments has dipped as population-wide immunity has increased from vaccines and prior infections. Pfizer and rivals have begun selling an updated COVID vaccine for this fall. \"We remain proud that our scientific breakthroughs played a significant role in getting the global health crisis under control,\" Pfizer CEO Albert Boura said in a statement. \"As we gain additional clarity around vaccination and treatment rates for COVID, we will be better able to estimate the appropriate level of supply to meet demand.\" The drugmaker said it now expects 2023 revenue of between $58 billion and $61 billion, down from its prior forecast of $67 billion to $70 billion. It said the reduction was solely due to lowered expectations for its COVID-19 products. Pfizer said it will take a non-cash charge of $5.5 billion in the third quarter to write off $4.6 billion of Paxlovid and $900 million of inventory write-offs and other charges for the vaccine. The cost-cutting program, which will target savings of at least $3.5 billion annually by the end of 2024, will include layoffs, the company said, without providing details on how many jobs will be cut or from what areas. One-time costs to achieve the savings are expected to be around $3 billion. Shares of the New York-based company were down about 7% in extended trading. Pfizer slashed its forecast for sales of its antiviral COVID treatment Paxlovid by about $7 billion, including a non-cash $4.2 billion revenue reversal, as it agreed to allow the return of 7.9 million courses purchased by the U.S. government. It had previously expected Paxlovid revenue of about $8 billion for the year. Pfizer said that under a deal with the U.S. government, a credit for the returned Paxlovid doses will underwrite a program to supply the drug free-of-charge to uninsured and underinsured Americans through 2028 and to patients insured under the government's Medicare and Medicaid programs through the end of next year. Pfizer will also provide the U.S. government 1 million courses of Paxlovid for the Strategic National Stockpile. The company expects the drug will become commercially available to people with private insurance in Jan. 1. Pfizer also cut full-year revenue expectations for the COVID vaccine by about $2 billion due to lower-than-expected vaccination rates. Pfizer said its non-COVID products remain on track to achieve 6% to 8% revenue growth year over year in 2023.

Henrietta Treyz, Veda Partners Managing Partner and Director of Economic Policy Research, belives it will be difficult for Jordan to rally sufficient bipartisan support to secure the House Speakership. With the Speaker race unsettled, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC) is tasked with overseeing the vote as Speaker Pro Tempore. However, pressing global issues are arising, from Israel-Hamas tensions to Ukraine aid, requiring legislative action. Given the uncertainty around the Speaker vote, Treyz suggests current Pro Tempore McHenry becoming Speaker may be the \"path of least resistance.\" \"Remember these are the players of the game, these congressmen, but they're also the referees,\" Treyz tells Yahoo Finance, adding: \"So when they need to change the rules they do.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live. JOSH LIPTON: House Republicans scrambling now to pick their next speaker. House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan now has a challenger, Congressman Austin Scott. This coming after Steve Scalise dropped out because he wasn't able to secure the votes needed to become speaker. Joining us now is Henrietta Treyz, Veda Partners Managing Partner and Director of Economic Policy Research. So Henrietta, Scalise out, withdrew from the contest. Walk us through what happens next. HENRIETTA TREYZ: Well, as we speak right now, the House Republican conference is going into an internal meeting to see if they can take votes and choose between their two remaining candidates as you just mentioned, Scott and Jordan. My opinion was the same today as it has been since November of last year after the midterms. I don't see how Jim Jordan gets the votes from the moderate wing of the Republican Party to get to the 217 votes that they have. There is some optimism. Members of both parties have been alerted that votes could happen through the weekend. But it looks like a heavy lift to me. And again, I don't see how Jim Jordan gets 217 votes. So this could easily be on the table for us next week and the week after. We really need a piece of major legislation to need urgent House action. Otherwise, you're just seeing this posturing and internal Republican infighting that really has been present for years now bubbling over with this latest speaker's drama. JULIE HYMAN: Henrietta, I have sort of a dumb question for you. What does the speaker of the House do? And if there is legislation that needs to be approved next week or the week after, does a speaker of the House need to be in place in order for that to get passed? HENRIETTA TREYZ: Not a dumb question at all. In fact, the speaker pro tempore, which is a position that was created only in the wake of some relatively near-term events historically is Patrick McHenry. He's there, and he's been meeting with the House parliamentarian who is basically the referee to figure out how exhaustive his authority might actually be. According to the rules right now, all he's really supposed to be able to do is convene the vote for the next speaker of the House. But obviously, now we're engaging in a war. Israel is at war. We need aid to Ukraine. We need funding for the US-Mexico border and aid to Taiwan. All of those are pressing issues that the White House is asking for legislation on as early as next week. The Senate is going to return on Monday night. And by Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, there could be a bill that the House needs to vote on that, by the way, many members of the House want to vote on. And we don't even know if the speaker pro tempore is legally allowed to bring that bill to the floor. So it's a really smart question and one that lawmakers have been studying with the parliamentarian since McCarthy got ousted. My opinion is that the longer this drags on, the more authority the speaker pro tempore will be authorized. One of the things that we like to say in DC is, remember, these are the players in the game, these congressmen. But they're also the referees. So when they need to change the rules, they do. And the more dysfunctional DC gets, the longer the Republican infighting flows and we remain without a speaker, my forecast is that the more power they are going a lot to the speaker pro tempore a position and effectively create precedent that puts Patrick McHenry effectively in the speaker's seat, which is I think maybe the path of least resistance at this point."

        "text": " (Adds details on misconduct complaint in paragraphs 5-6) By Dietrich Knauth NEW YORK, Oct 13 (Reuters) - U.S. Bankruptcy Judge David Jones in Houston, who oversees more major Chapter 11 cases than any other U.S. judge, said on Friday he is facing an ethics review over a previously undisclosed romantic relationship and is stepping down from handling large cases. Jones said over the weekend he has been in a years-long romantic relationship and shared a home with bankruptcy attorney Elizabeth Freeman, who had been a law clerk for him. Until recently, Freeman worked at Jackson Walker, a local law firm that filed many cases in Jones' Houston courthouse. Jones said at a court hearing in the bankruptcy case of drilling company Arethusa Offshore that he is under investigation from the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and that all his bankruptcy cases involving large companies would be assigned to other judges during the investigation. \"I hope that you can appreciate that the integrity of the process is simply more important than a single case and you have my genuine apologies for the inconvenience that I am causing,\" Jones told the company's attorneys. Chief 5th U.S. Circuit Judge Priscilla Richman, in a misconduct complaint made public later on Friday, said there was probable cause to believe Jones violated the codes of conduct that govern judges by, among other things, failing to avoid an appearance of impropriety. Richman said that while Jones and Freeman were not married, the factors that apply to recusing from a case involving a judge's spouse apply equally when a judge maintains both a household and an intimate relationship with someone they are not married to. Yet, she wrote, Jones never recused himself from cases involving Jackson Walker or disclosed his relationship with Freeman. The judge approved attorneys' fees sought by Jackson Walker for work on bankruptcy matters in which billing records showed Freeman performed \"substantial\" services, Richman said. The Houston bankruptcy court on Friday also updated its case assignment rules to remove Jones from a two-judge panel that oversees all complex cases involving more than $200 million in debt. Legal ethics experts have said Jones should have disclosed the relationship or recused himself from cases involving Jackson Walker. A spokesman for Jackson Walker said the firm consulted outside ethics counsel after learning about the romantic relationship in March 2021. \"From the time we first learned of this allegation Ms. Freeman was instructed not to work or bill on any cases before Judge Jones,\" Jackson Walker spokesman Jim Wilkinson said. \"We are confident that we acted responsibly.\" Freeman, through her attorney, declined to comment. Jones has been the busiest bankruptcy judge in the U.S. since January 2016, overseeing 11% of all Chapter 11 bankruptcies involving more than $100 million in liabilities, according to data from Debtwire, which provides research and intelligence on credit markets. He recently presided over the bankruptcies of JC Penney, Neiman Marcus, Party City and Chesapeake Energy, among many others. The two-judge panel for complex cases is an outlier among U.S. bankruptcy courts, which typically assign cases randomly among all of their judges. Bankruptcy Judge Marvin Isgur, who stepped down from the panel a year ago, will replace Jones, and all of Jones' complex cases will be randomly assigned to Isgur or the panel's other member, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez.

        "text": " There\u2019s a distinction between the lower, middle and upper classes, but did you know that there\u2019s also a category in between the latter two called the \u201cupper middle\u201d class? While those in the middle class are often considered fairly financially stable, the upper middle class tend to have a higher net worth and even more financial security \u2014 just perhaps not quite as much as the truly wealthy. Bill Gates: 7 Things He Won\u2019t Waste Money OnFind Out: What To Do If You Owe Back Taxes to the IRS As you start improving your income and building your net worth, you may be wondering just when you\u2019ve gone from the middle to upper middle class. While there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all definition, and monetary amounts tend to vary, there are certain signs that you\u2019ve made the jump. Here\u2019s what the upper middle class is, and the top signs that you\u2019re there. People in the middle class and the upper middle class may both benefit from a higher standard of living, less financial stress, and more financial freedom or stability. However, there are some differences between the two tiers. Here\u2019s how Nicole Nicolet, owner of Let\u2019s Make Life Great, defined the two categories. \u201cThe middle class can be defined as anyone who is able to afford a reasonable standard of living, including owning a home, going on yearly or bi-yearly vacations, and being able to support future investments like part of a college education for their children. In most cases, they will have to work up to the expected retirement age. The upper middle class is able to afford a little above the standard of living of the middle class.\u201d The upper middle class often gets to enjoy more vacations, has minimal to no debt, and is on track to retire \u2014 and live comfortably once retired \u2014 without issue. \u201cMiddle class typically involves stable income and some savings, with incomes between $50,000 and $125,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Upper middle class might mean earning 15-50% above the median with a comfortable financial cushion, while the upper class generally refers to the top 1-3% earners with substantial wealth and investment-derived income,\u201d said Jeff Rose, CFP and founder of GoodFinancialCents.com. Some sources define upper middle class as anyone who\u2019s making a lot of money but hasn\u2019t quite crossed the threshold to become truly wealthy yet. These individuals often have a net worth of at least $500,000 to $2 million. More: 4 Top Ways To Become Rich Without Working 12 Months a Year In addition to having a high income and net worth, here are eight other key signs that you\u2019ve made it to the upper middle class. People in the middle class often have disposable income, but those in the upper middle class have money left over even after they\u2019ve maxed out their retirement account contributions and taken care of their other major investments and expenses. They also have far less concern or stress about using said money since they\u2019re more financially secure. \u201cCracking into the upper middle class? You\u2019ll probably notice a few key things,\u201d said Rose. \u201cFirst off, you\u2019ve got some wiggle room in your budget for the fun stuff \u2014 think vacations and regular nights out. You\u2019re not just socking money away for retirement, but you\u2019ve got a mix of investments like stocks or maybe even a rental property.\u201d When you\u2019re in the upper middle class, you have more than just cash at your disposal. You also have a diversified portfolio with assets such as stocks and rental properties that can boost your income and enhance your financial security. Even if your total net worth is distributed across multiple assets, it still adds up to a significant amount. You may also have fully paid off your mortgage, though this isn\u2019t necessarily required. \u201cOne sign that you are in the upper middle class may include being able to pay off big investments, like a mortgage, years early, without restricting your lifestyle,\u201d said Nicolet. If you do have a mortgage, it\u2019s one that you\u2019re very comfortable with and isn\u2019t dragging you down financially. Another way to see if you\u2019ve made it to upper middle class is to simply take a look at where you live. According to Rose, if \u201cyour home is in a ZIP code where folks want to live,\u201d that\u2019s a good sign that you\u2019re there. Keep in mind that it\u2019s not all about appearances. People in the middle class might try to keep up with the Joneses \u2014 that is, they might compare themselves with their neighbors and try to match their level of wealth or status. Those in the upper middle class, however, do not. They don\u2019t need to worry about whether their house is big enough or their car is luxurious enough. They can afford many of these high-end things without needing to stretch their financial means. One of the biggest indicators that you\u2019ve made it to the upper middle class is if you have little to no stress when faced with an unexpected bill or expense. If a financial emergency does come up, you also know that you can cover it without a problem. \u201cIf an unexpected bill popped up, you could cover it without panicking,\u201d said Rose. Having significantly more disposable income and a higher net worth often comes with major lifestyle changes. This doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re suddenly living above your means. Rather, it means you can afford more than you ever could before, including goods and services that you used to view as being a luxury or out of reach. It also means you can afford things like medical expenses, travel, and more expensive hobbies or interests. \u201cBeing in the upper class means almost no restrictions on lifestyle. Not billionaire rich, but certainly without any limitations to enjoy most standards of living,\u201d said Nicolet. \u201cAdditionally, being in the upper middle class means that you are able to easily afford more leisure purchases like recreational vehicles, sporty cars, and maybe even a small vacation home in popular vacation spots.\u201d This is similar to what you might experience in the upper class, but perhaps a tier lower. \u201cIf you are in the upper class, then you will be able to afford essentially any purchase you want, without ever having to choose a payment plan or worry about future financial deficits,\u201d added Nicolet. \u201cThe upper class is an interest-free, and interesting life.\u201d The cost of higher education is high, and many people who go to college or university end up with student loan debt. Those in the upper middle class, meanwhile, can afford to attend college \u2014 or send their children to college \u2014 without having to take on this debt. \u201cYou can swing the better educational opportunities for your kids (or yourself!) without sweating over the price tag,\u201d said Rose. \u201cThese are all little financial wins that hint you\u2019re sitting pretty in the upper middle class.\u201d Retiring early is the dream for many people, but it might not feel that achievable if you\u2019re struggling with debt or everyday expenses. For the upper middle class, this isn\u2019t as much of an issue due to factors like diversified investments, passive income, and overall financial security. \u201cIn most cases, being in the upper middle class also signifies that you can retire early, without much concern for financial troubles down the road,\u201d said Nicolet. While those in the lower and middle classes may only have one source of income, wealthier individuals almost always have two or more income streams. This could include a high-paying job. But it could also include owning a business or having a passive income source like dividends from investments or rental property income. By no means is this a comprehensive list of signs that you\u2019ve made it to the upper middle class. Everyone\u2019s situation is different, and definitions of class vary broadly. What one person might consider as upper middle class could be a tier higher or lower than another\u2019s definition of it. What matters is determining where you\u2019re at right now financially, and where you want to be. If there are still things that stress you out financially, you might still have a ways to go. But if you\u2019re living comfortably and enjoying the lifestyle of your dreams, chances are you\u2019re already where you want to be.

But there are growing signs that the economic miracle has ended and that the path to further growth in the years ahead will be more difficult. But does that mean China has lost its chance to ever overtake the United States? Commercial real estate has outperformed the S&P 500 over 25 years. Here's how to diversify your portfolio without the headache of being a landlord Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market \u2014 and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds \u2018A natural way to diversify': Janet Yellen now says Americans should expect a decline in the USD as the world's reserve currency \u2014 3 ways you can prepare Here\u2019s a closer look. China\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, adjusted for inflation, surged from $293 in 1985 to more than $12,000 in 2021. Demographics, exports and capital investments made this economic miracle possible. China\u2019s enormous population \u2014 the largest in the world until India\u2019s recently surpassed it \u2014 served as cheap labor for assembling goods that were exported aggressively. Meanwhile, the government invested heavily in infrastructure to support this export-led growth model and boost standards of living. However, China\u2019s economy has shifted from export-centric to a consumer-led, debt-fueled model in recent years. This model is now at risk. Read more: Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate \u2014 without the headache of being a landlord. Here's how China\u2019s recent trade tensions with the U.S., which kicked off under former President Donald Trump\u2019s administration and have continued under President Joe Biden\u2019s, have disrupted a trading relationship that was integral to the economic \u201cmiracle\u201d of the past four decades or so. Meanwhile, wages have been rising rapidly, according to the country\u2019s own National Bureau of Statistics, thus diminishing the gap between Chinese workers and rivals in other markets. Consequently, China reported that its exports were down 14.5% year-over-year, as of July. Earlier in the year, Beijing said its economy had grown by only 3% in 2022, the slowest pace since the mid-1970s, not counting 2020, the first COVID year. The demographics have shifted too. Not only is China no longer the world\u2019s most populous country; it\u2019s actually experiencing population decline that could, according to UN estimates, see the country\u2019s population fall to less than a billion by 2080 and then less than 800 million by 2100. Perhaps the biggest threat to China\u2019s economic prospects is its addiction to real estate. Property has traditionally been considered the safest way to save and safeguard capital in China. Now, residential and commercial real estate accounts for 25% of the country\u2019s economy. Plunging home prices and failing high-profile developers like Evergrande could create a debt crisis. In light of all this, geopolitical analyst Peter Zeihanhas told Joe Rogan he believes China probably has another 10 years before facing significant civil unrest and economic decline. China\u2019s economic growth has given it immense influence over geopolitics in recent decades. The end of that growth has major implications for the world. It could mean that trade, finance and geopolitics could be U.S.-centric for longer than expected. U.S. per capita GDP is $75,269, about six times higher than China\u2019s. The economy expanded 2.1% in the most recent quarter, and growth is expected to remain steady until 2033. The U.S. dollar still dominates trade and international commerce, while the country accounts for 12.4% of global economic activity. It\u2019s difficult to predict the future of either the U.S. or Chinese economy. Sudden shifts in geopolitics or breakthroughs in technology would shift the picture. China could still have a chance to overtake its biggest rival. But based on current projections, this seems unlikely. Policymakers and investors around the world might want to prepare for a world where China\u2019s continuing growth is no longer taken for granted. Worried about the economy? Here are the best shock-proof assets for your portfolio. (They\u2019re all outside of the stock market.)

        "text": " If you\u2019re bringing home $60,000 each year, it might feel impossible to actually buy a home. A $60K salary is around $14,000 less than the median household income in the country \u2014 $74,580, per the most recent Census data \u2014 which falls in the bottom half of earners. And at the same time, housing prices and mortgage rates seem to be getting higher and higher. However, homeownership is not necessarily out of your reach. In fact, a $60,000 annual income may even make you eligible for financial assistance programs created to help make the cost of homebuying less overwhelming. Read on to understand what kind of house you can afford on a $60K salary. The 28/36 rule is a framework to help you avoid stretching your budget too thin \u2014 many lenders follow it when assessing mortgage applications. Using this as a guide, you should avoid spending more than 28 percent of your monthly income on your housing payment, and you should try to cap your entire debt load \u2014 not just housing costs but also credit card, car and student loan payments \u2014 at 36 percent of your earnings. Here\u2019s a simple look at how the 28/36 rule applies to your $60K salary: Calculator $60,000/12 = $5,000 per month $5,000 x 0.28 = $1,400 (your target maximum for a monthly mortgage payment) $5,000 x 0.36 = $1,800 (your target maximum for your entire debt obligations) However, figuring out how much you can spend on a house isn\u2019t just about a few numbers. A lender is going to take a look at your entire financial picture to determine what you can afford. And keep in mind that the $1,400 monthly mortgage cost does not include a down payment and closing costs, which must be paid upfront. With the 28/36 rule as your North Star, you should aim to spend no more than $1,400 on your monthly mortgage payment. What kind of a house will that get you? Let\u2019s say you qualify for a 30-year loan with a 7.5 interest rate. Based on Bankrate\u2019s mortgage calculator, you should look for a home that costs $200,000. If you can afford a 20 percent down payment \u2014 $40,000 \u2014 your monthly principal and interest payment for that size mortgage loan will be $1,118. That gives you a bit of a cushion to build in the extra costs for property taxes and homeowners insurance, which are both part of that monthly housing cost and which vary widely depending on your location. However, you\u2019ll be in better shape if you don\u2019t max out that $1,400 cap. You don\u2019t want to be house-poor: Keeping your payment a bit lower will help you account for everyday expenses like utilities, food, transportation and all the other factors that make up your total cost of living. Here are some other things to keep in mind when figuring out how much house you can afford: Your credit score plays a key role in your house-hunting budget. The higher your score is, the lower your mortgage rate will likely be \u2014 which translates to less interest and a lower monthly payment. While it\u2019s possible to get a mortgage with a relatively low credit score, a low score will deem you a high-risk borrower, which means the lender will probably charge you a significant premium. Work to bring your credit score up as high as you can before applying for a mortgage loan. Saving for a down payment is hard \u2014 20 percent down on a $200,000 home is $40,000, which can feel like an insurmountable sum on a $60K salary. Contrary to popular belief, though, you don\u2019t have to put 20 percent down to buy a home. Some conventional lenders require a down payment of just 3 percent of the purchase price, and FHA loans require just 3.5 percent if your credit score is at least 580. However, an upfront contribution of less than 20 percent means you have to borrow more. It also means you\u2019ll have to pay for private mortgage insurance, which will add to your monthly payment at a time when you\u2019re trying to save. If family help is a possibility, you may be able to cover part of your down payment with gift funds from a parent or relative. Your $60,000 salary goes a lot further in some markets than others, so where you\u2019re hoping to live makes a particularly big difference here. A $200,000 price point makes for a challenging house-hunt these days, given that the nationwide median home price, according to the National Association of Realtors, is more than $400,000. But don\u2019t let that discourage you: There are still plenty of affordable housing markets in the country. Be sure to cast a wide net to see where you can stretch your income as far as possible. And if you can\u2019t make the math work on a single-family home in your desired area, consider a condo or townhouse, which will likely be significantly cheaper. Just as there are loads of different kinds of homes to buy, there are many options to come up with the money you need to make one of them your own. Here\u2019s a rundown of the most common types you\u2019ll come across: Conventional loans: Conventional loans require a minimum credit score of 620, but 740 and above will get you the best terms. FHA loans: Your $60K salary may see you leaning toward this option \u2014 government-guaranteed FHA loans are appealing to borrowers with lower income and lower credit scores. If you qualify, a score of 580 or above requires just a 3.5 percent down payment, while a score of 500 to 579 requires 10 perent down. USDA loans: You\u2019ll need to qualify as a low- or moderate-income buyer for a USDA loan \u2014 which your $60K salary may well help you do. They\u2019re only for buyers in qualifying rural areas, though, so if you\u2019re looking in a city they\u2019re not an option for you. VA loans: If you are a current military service member or a veteran, you may qualify for a zero-down-payment VA loan. The first time buying a home tends to be the most difficult: You aren\u2019t selling a previous home, so you have no sale proceeds to put toward a down payment. However, this is an area where your $60K salary can be especially useful: It may make you eligible for any number of down payment assistance programs designed to ease the upfront expense of homebuying. These can come in the form of grants, low-interest loans or forgivable loans that help you cover down payment and closing costs. Regardless of where you want to live or how much you can contribute to a down payment, there is one essential thing you need to do: Get preapproved for a mortgage. This will give you a clear picture of how much a lender is likely to let you borrow, which gives you a solid budget to stay within. Remember, though, the key word is \u201clikely\u201d \u2014 after a preapproval, you\u2019ll still need to apply officially. On a $60,000 salary, your list of buying options is likely to be limited. So it\u2019s essential to work with a local real estate agent who knows your market well. A savvy agent can help you find neighborhoods and listings that meet your budget, and can also guide you through the most cost-efficient homebuying path possible."

The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate increased to 7.49% last week \u2014 up from the prior week\u2019s average of 7.31% \u2014 and hitting the highest level since 2000. At the same time, house prices continue to rise, primarily due to low inventory. Commercial real estate has outperformed the S&P 500 over 25 years. Here's how to diversify your portfolio without the headache of being a landlord Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market \u2014 and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds \u2018A natural way to diversify': Janet Yellen now says Americans should expect a decline in the USD as the world's reserve currency \u2014 3 ways you can prepare \u201c[House] prices aren\u2019t going to go anywhere but up, even with interest rates going up,\u201d Ramsey said on a recent episode of \u201cFOX & Friends\u201d. \u201cThe housing market is just stalled and, man, we've got Bloody Sunday with the student loans kicking back in Sunday and Christmas is bearing down on us so it is time to get on a budget and get on a plan.\u201d With that in mind, Ramsey says you shouldn\u2019t sit back and wait for conditions to improve \u2014 reminding potential buyers that you can always refinance your home loan to get a better rate down the road. Rather, he says you should go ahead and buy a home \u2014 but only \u201cif you\u2019re out of debt and you\u2019ve got your emergency fund.\u201d Here\u2019s how you can hit Ramsey\u2019s critical financial conditions to buy your dream home \u2014 plus some other ways to invest in real estate while dodging housing market headwinds. Ramsey was joined on \u201cFOX & Friends\u201d by his \u201cThe Ramsey Show\u201d co-host George Kamel, who backed Ramsey\u2019s bold housing call and mirrored his advice around becoming debt free. \u201cIf you\u2019re a millennial or you\u2019re Gen Z, you\u2019re feeling hopeless right now, you\u2019re feeling cynical,\u201d says Kamel. \u201cYour parents are saying: \u2018You\u2019re throwing away money on rent, get a house, get a house, get a house\u2019 \u2014 and you\u2019re broke. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have some patience because rent and mortgages are not apples to apples,\u201d Kamel said, adding buying a home also comes with taxes and insurance \u2014 and in some cases, homeowners\u2019 association fees and private mortgage insurance. All those expenses can add up, which is why he argues it\u2019s important to ensure you\u2019re debt free with an emergency fund established before making an offer. There are several methods you can use to pay down your debts. In his well-known seven \u201cbaby steps\u201d to financial success, Ramsey advocates for the snowball method, where you pay off the smallest debt (or account with the lowest balance) first and make only minimum payments on all of your other outstanding debts. Once you\u2019ve paid off your smallest debt, you move on to the next smallest debt, and so on. It\u2019s also important to keep an eye on the interest you\u2019re paying on your debt. If you rack up too much high-interest debt on your credit card or your car loan, you could fall behind on your payments, be subject to financial penalties and your balance can quickly spiral out of control, making it even harder to get debt free. To succeed in this journey, you\u2019ll need to stick to a budget that breaks down your monthly income into necessities, wants, savings and debt repayments. Read more: Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate \u2014 without the headache of being a landlord. Here's how Ramsey believes every adult American should have at least $1,000 set aside to cover life\u2019s inevitable challenges. For instance, if you\u2019re suddenly slapped with a big medical bill or your car breaks down, that back-up fund will stop you from falling into financial distress. Beyond that, Ramsey says you should save three to six months worth of living expenses \u2014 including your rent or mortgage, other loan repayments, grocery and energy bills and other regular expenditures \u2014 to cover larger surprises like a job layoff or a long hospital stay. Wherever you are on your savings journey, you might consider stashing some cash in a high-yield savings account (HYSA). With an HYSA, you could earn more interest on your money and benefit from greater compound growth than you would with a traditional savings or checking account. You may also want to consider using other high-yield savings products like money market deposit accounts (MMDA) or a certificate of deposit (CD) to make the most of the current high interest rates. But remember that banks and credit unions will often charge an early withdrawal penalty for taking money out of a CD before its maturity date. Once you\u2019ve hit those two financial milestones \u2014 paying down your debt and building an emergency fund \u2014 then Ramsey says you should go ahead and buy a house (if that\u2019s what you want to do). But if you\u2019re unconvinced, there are other ways to get a foothold in the real estate market without dealing with the extensive costs of homeownership. For instance, you may want to consider putting your money in a real estate investment trust (REIT), which are publicly-traded companies that collect rent from tenants and pass that rent to shareholders in the form of regular dividend payments. There are also online crowdfunding platforms that allow everyday investors to pool their money to purchase property (or a share of property) as a group. If you don\u2019t want to make investment decisions on your own, some new online platforms can even help you invest in diversified real estate portfolios that will maximize your returns while keeping your fees low.

        "text": " In a long-awaited development, the largest audit in the history of the IRS has finally taken its next step. On Wednesday, Microsoft announced that the agency had notified the company that it owes $28.9 billion in back taxes, plus penalties and interest. The case is epic not only in dollars but in scope. As ProPublica reported in an in-depth narrative in 2020, in a story co-published with Fortune, the IRS saw the case as a chance to prove the agency\u2019s effectiveness. Often cowed by the prospect of facing off against corporations with endless resources, the IRS set out to be bolder and more aggressive. It took the unusual step of hiring a corporate law firm to represent the agency, a step that incensed Microsoft. The company, along with others in its industry, responded by rallying allies in Congress to rein in the IRS. The audit is already well over a decade old and figures to grow older, since Microsoft is allowed to appeal the IRS\u2019 conclusions and says it plans to. The audit focused on a deal the agency would later describe as \u201cillusory in nature, serving no material economic purpose except to shift income.\u201d In 2005, ProPublica wrote, Microsoft \u201csold its most valuable possession\u2014its intellectual property\u2014to an 85-person factory it owned in a small Puerto Rican city.\u201d Having struck a favorable tax deal with Puerto Rico, Microsoft then channeled its profits to the facility, which burned Windows and Office software onto CDs. At the time, some Microsoft executives celebrated this \u201cpure tax play,\u201d and they had reason for optimism. Initially, the IRS did not take an aggressive tack. An early audit resulted in a much more modest change in 2011. But earlier that same year, the IRS had set up a new unit to audit intra-company deals that sent U.S. profits to tax havens \u2014 deals that were especially common among tech companies like Google, Facebook and Apple. The leader of the new unit decided that Microsoft\u2019s deal in Puerto Rico was worth a much closer look. The IRS withdrew its initial finding and dug in to build a deep, comprehensive case. By the time ProPublica published its story on the audit in 2020, the two sides had sued each other, and one case had long been stuck in court. Almost three years after the last motions in the case, a federal judge still had not ruled on whether the IRS should receive documents it was seeking. Shortly after ProPublica asked the court for an update, the ruling finally came down. The judge sided with the IRS, writing \u201cthe Court finds itself unable to escape the conclusion that a significant purpose, if not the sole purpose, of Microsoft\u2019s transactions was to avoid or evade federal income tax.\u201d He agreed with the IRS\u2019 characterization of the deal as a tax shelter. For the next three years, the case disappeared from public view until Microsoft\u2019s announcement. \u201cWe believe we have always followed the IRS\u2019 rules and paid the taxes we owe in the U.S. and around the world,\u201d wrote Daniel Goff, a senior Microsoft executive, in\u00a0a blog post on the company\u2019s site\u00a0that revealed the IRS\u2019 determination. The $29 billion that the IRS was seeking, he wrote, covered 2004 to 2013. He asserted, however, that the total, were the IRS to ultimately prevail, would be reduced by about $10 billion in taxes that Microsoft has already paid on its overseas profits. A major feature of President Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 tax bill was a requirement that companies repatriate those profits, though they paid a special, low tax rate when they did. Microsoft had stored up $142 billion in offshore profits by 2017. The conclusion of the audit sends the fight to a new phase. The IRS has an internal appeals division, and Microsoft said it would pursue its arguments there. It\u2019s a significant development since the IRS had once signaled that it would bar Microsoft\u2019s access to an appeal, a stance that led to blowback in Congress from the company\u2019s allies. IRS appeals officers, who are independent of the auditors, often settle cases for steep discounts out of fear that the agency will lose a court battle. The appeals process is secret. If Microsoft does not get the result it wants there, it can take its case to the U.S. Tax Court. Each step is likely to take years, meaning the case could easily stretch into the late 2020s. The IRS attorneys who worked on the case believed it to be, by far, the largest U.S. audit ever, and the amount the IRS is seeking from Microsoft is several times larger than in any other publicly disclosed audit in the agency\u2019s history. The case, in a way, is the last, great vestige of the IRS before it was\u00a0gutted by budget cuts over the course of the 2010s\u00a0and corporate audits plummeted. While the recent infusion of billions from the Inflation Reduction Act will allow the agency to rebuild itself in the coming years, the Microsoft case shows the fruit of those efforts could take a long, long time to reap.

Dubai, UAE --News Direct-- Prodigy Press Wire Mr. Subhajit Waugh, a scientist/physicist at Raja Ramanna Center for Advanced Technology (RRCAT), has claimed (based on strong evidences emanating from his groundbreaking research) that physics and cosmology are both in crisis because we are wrong about the shape, size and workings of the universe. This is in logical continuation to his two earlier articles which appeared in Yahoo sites: 1) RRCAT Physicist Proposes New Theory Unifying General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics 2) RRCAT Physicist Claims Correct Representation of Imaginary Numbers May Unify General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Night sky vision of the Universe Edwin Hubble's discovery of an expanding universe, when coupled with a quest to locate the 'center of mass' of the universe leads to a shocking revelation. The most important discovery about the universe happened in the early 20th century at Mt. Wilson Observatory. Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe is expanding. But that is not the end of the story, because our presently accepted model of the universe cannot even satisfactorily answer an innocent question which a child might ask \"if our universe is expanding, what it is expanding into?\" Even more embarrassingly, scientists have not been able to locate a center of the universe. Scientists try to avoid the question by taking refuge to 'an infinitely large universe'. But there is a big problem. In the vastness of our cosmos, each galaxy can be considered as a point mass. Even when the number of galaxies (n) tends to infinity, there remains a single point as the center of mass. The mere invocation of infinity will not dissuade anyone from the conclusion that there is indeed a center. Only a balloon shaped universe can rescue cosmology from this situation. There is a true center of the balloon, but it does not lie anywhere on the surface. The only difference is: a balloon has a 2D surface, and exists in 3D space; while the (hyper) balloon universe has a 3D surface and exists in 4D (hyper) space. A recent, Nature Astronomy paper (Ref.1) had claimed with 99% confidence level that our universe is closed. Another paper (Ref.2) claimed betting odds of 2000 \u2236 1 against an open, flat and infinite universe. Both papers have mortally wounded the presently accepted, Standard Model of Cosmology (SMC). Major cracks have appeared in the standard model of cosmology. Eight serious shortcomings of the SMC are highlighted (Ref.3A). Each of these points is serious on its own. When taken together, one must agree that cosmology is in crisis, and it is time for a complete paradigm shift. Physics currently rests on two pillars: General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Mechanics (QM). However GR and QM are mutually inconsistent, and there are bitter conflict between the two greatest theories of physics (Ref.3B). Physics is in crisis too, which is publicly accepted by physicists themselves (Ref.3C). Mr. Subhajit Waugh, has boldly claimed that Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity appears to be incompatible because we are using the wrong model of the universe (4A). He has provided the exact shape and size of the universe (Ref.4B). Scientists and experts in the field can look at these (Ref.5, 6, 7). Mr. Waugh has claimed that an 'expanding (hyper) balloon' model of the universe leads to 'unified physics and cosmology', which comes pretty close to the \u2018theory of everything\u2019. Edwin Hubble had observed that galaxies are moving away from Earth at speeds proportional to their distance. In other words, the farther they are, the faster they are moving away from Earth. Scientists realized that this particular form of Hubble's law made sense if an expanding balloon is used as an analogy of the universe. Mr. Waugh asserts that they were right and their idea should not have been discarded. He also asserts that the wall of the balloon universe is made up of invisible scalar fields (somewhat similar to invisible electric and magnetic fields) and particles (which are mere excitations/resonances in those fields, just as the stunningly accurate 'Quantum Field Theory' insists). Since stars and planets and even humans are made up of particles, therefore every matter is eternally trapped within the 3D hypersurface of fields which makes up the wall of the (hyper) balloon. Mr. Waugh lamented that it was very unfortunate that scientists had not realized that the FLRW metric, which is the heart of SMC, actually paints this picture of the universe! Mr. Waugh used an analogy to a party balloon to illustrate his point. As the balloon expands, two things happen simultaneously. 1) A point/dot on the wall of the balloon moves away from the true center of the balloon along the radius of the balloon. This is what the temporal part of FLRW metric says. Movement along the radius of the universe appears as passage of time for trapped humans. 2) Nearby dots on the balloon appear to move farther away from each other due to the expansion of the wall of the balloon. This gives rise to Hubble's law. [NOTE :- Taking the radial increment/expansion velocity of the universe as c and the age of the universe as 13.8 billion years, the value of the Hubble constant obtained using Waugh's model (71.002 km/s/Mpc) agrees well with the accepted values (69.8 and 74 km/s/Mpc measured by two different methods).] Mr. Waugh has asserted that the biggest mistake in Science is the concept of four-dimensional 'SpaceTime continuum' (Ref.8). Einstein and Minkowski merged the three dimensions of space and one dimension of time into a single, 4D manifold called SpaceTime. This leads to a \u2018block universe\u2019 view in which there is no distinction between the past, the present and the future, and all three of them simultaneously coexist. This view is in stark contrast to our everyday experience, as well as with an astonishing number of observations in the whole of science. In fact, an entire book has been written to highlight this glaring mistake [The arrow of time: the quest to solve science\u2019s greatest mystery (Peter Coveney, Roger Highfield)]. The above-mentioned mistake arose from improper/incomplete understanding of imaginary numbers (Ref.9). An imaginary sign hides in the crucial Minkowski-Einstein SpaceTime equation. Although, immensely successful, it is NOT an equation of 4D SpaceTime continuum. It all boils down to one missing dimension, which has created a mess in physics and cosmology. Every SpaceTime metric (e.g. FLRW metric, Minkowski metric, and even the Schwarzchild metric which is the foundation for our present understanding of gravity) are mathematically accurate, but have a completely different physical interpretation from what is currently accepted. The temporal part of both FLRW metric and Minkowski metric are similar (and implies that the 3D hypersurface is moving with a velocity c in the 4th dimension). That has been completely ignored by scientists while creating a model for the universe, and emphasis is put only on the scale factor a(t), which plays the role of Hubble's law. In fact, Relativity is all about being trapped on the surface wall of the expanding (hyper) balloon universe. Waugh\u2019s model of the universe implies the existence of two different frames of reference/viewpoints: the center of the universe viewpoint, and the viewpoint of humans from an awkward position in the universe. As already mentioned, Relativity is our viewpoint, while Quantum Mechanics is Nature\u2019s viewpoint (or God\u2019s viewpoint from the center of the universe). The universe is perceived differently from each viewpoint, but it is precisely this which allows the reconciliation between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. This concept has profound implications for several concepts like wave-particle duality, Lagrangian\u2013Hamiltonian duality, quantum entanglement and even the conservation laws of Physics. From the center of universe viewpoint, simultaneity is absolute (as demanded by Sagnac effect), and there is indeed absolute universal time (as demanded by quantum mechanics) because the time passed since the Big Bang is simply a function of the radius of the universe. From our viewpoint, locality is absolute, and velocity c is the upper limit, and remains constant for every observer. Those were Einstein\u2019s firm belief, which were later shattered by Quantum Entanglement experiments (which led to the award of year 2022\u2019s Nobel Prize in Physics). The constancy of the speed of light turns (our) space and time into inseparable twins, and makes (our) time a relative concept. This solves the problem of time (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_time) which so stubbornly resisted the reconciliation of Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity. Relativity changes into the realm of Quantum Mechanics with decreasing size scale due to exchanging roles of time and space. Mr. Waugh has claimed that science is standing on shaky mathematical pillars (Ref.10), and correcting the faulty mathematical assumptions guarantees an imminent \u2018paradigm shift\u2019 in science. He has delved into the three key steps to overthrow the reigning theories in physics and cosmology, and has made testable and falsifiable predictions that can shake up science to the core (Ref.11). He firmly believes that all three key steps to overthrow ruling scientific theories are met, and a major scientific revolution inevitable. Soon, Euclid telescope's data will show that the universe is positively curved, and hence is necessarily closed and finite (Ref.12). It will also prove that both Dark Energy and Dark Matter are tightly correlated to Normal Baryonic Matter (NBM), and hence unnecessary, and arise from wrong interpretation of General relativity. Euclid telescope has already completed its commissioning phase with flying colors. Both Relativity and Quantum Mechanics arise naturally (like two sides of the same coin) in Mr. Waugh's 'expanding (hyper) balloon' model of the universe. Hence it can supersede both theories, as well as replace the Standard Model of Cosmology.

        "text": " No matter how much you prepare, the realities of retirement are likely to surprise you as you prepare for and enter that phase of your life. It is, after all, one of the biggest milestone changes to your lifestyle and financial situation. Commercial real estate has outperformed the S&P 500 over 25 years. Here's how to diversify your portfolio without the headache of being a landlord \u2018A natural way to diversify': Janet Yellen now says Americans should expect a decline in the USD as the world's reserve currency \u2014 3 ways you can prepare Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market \u2014 and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds Moneywise has previously reported on important lifestyle changes many retirees are confronted with: the need to downsize their homes, managing a budget with less disposable income and the challenge of disentangling their identities from their careers \u2014 but the changes don\u2019t stop there. Whether your retirement is still a few years off or you\u2019re getting very close to that last day on the job, here are three more crucial things you must say goodbye to as you officially greet your golden years. After decades of aggressively accumulating capital, it can be difficult to adopt a more conservative investment strategy and \u201cwealth-preservation\u201d mindset. A survey found that nearly one-third of Americans over the age of 50 invested in volatile cryptocurrencies as part of their early retirement plan. One in five retirees over the age of 85 have their entire portfolio in stocks, which is considered risky by most financial advisors, according to a Vanguard survey. This is risky behavior at any age, but is particularly dangerous for seniors living on retirement savings, pension plans or Social Security benefits. It took stocks roughly four years to recover from the 2008 crash and Bitcoin is still trading well below its 2021 peak. If you\u2019re nearing or in retirement, you don\u2019t want to be waiting years to recoup major losses. Retirement is an opportunity to shift away from volatile, higher-risk investment strategies to reliable, income-producing strategies. Shifting to bonds and fixed income securities, asset-backed funds and real estate could be a better way to preserve wealth and secure your lifestyle as you transition out of the workforce. As you age, the chances that you\u2019ll find yourself in a hospital emergency room or doctor\u2019s clinic rise substantially. In fact, 92% of seniors have at least one chronic condition, while 77% have two or more, according to the American Psychological Association. And nearly two-thirds of bankruptcies are caused by medical expenses, making it the leading cause of financial ruin for people in the U.S., according to RetireGuide. Read more: Jeff Bezos and Oprah Winfrey invest in this asset to keep their wealth safe \u2014 you may want to do the same in 2023 Despite these worrying numbers, studies show millions of Americans wouldn\u2019t be able to cover even a small emergency expense without going into debt. This is why financial experts like Suze Orman recommend regularly contributing to an emergency fund for unexpected costs that may arise both now and in retirement. Traditional tax plans are designed for income-earning adults. But what happens when you retire and your income stops? What happens when you derive less income from work and much more from other sources such as dividends or income from a rental property? Tax-planning for retirement years can get complex. Instead of income taxes, you\u2019ll likely need to prepare to pay taxes on any social security benefits as well as some of your investments. If you\u2019re wealthy, your retirement tax plan also needs a new layer that wasn\u2019t needed before: estate planning. A 2023 study from senior living site Caring.com shows that despite a 3% increase over 2022 in Americans who have an estate plan, only 34% of Americans have an estate plan and 46% of Americans over the age of 55 have a will. If you do have a will, any assets or money you leave behind is subject to applicable taxes. While only people with more than $12.92 million in assets would be subject to a federal estate tax ranging from 18% to 40%, it is worth noting that 17 states and the District of Columbia also have either an estate or inheritance tax. Other changes to your tax plan might include complex strategies such as setting up a Roth conversion ladder. Not only are these tax plans complicated, they\u2019re also subject to change over the years. It\u2019s worth considering finding an financial adviser or accountant who can guide you through the changing tax landscape so you can ensure everything is in order and you have peace of mind while you enjoy your golden years. Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate \u2014 without the headache of being a landlord. Here's how Worried about the economy? Here are the best shock-proof assets for your portfolio. (They\u2019re all outside of the stock market.) Super-rich Americans are snatching up prime real estate abroad as US housing slumps \u2014 but here's a sharp way to invest without having to move overseas This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.
