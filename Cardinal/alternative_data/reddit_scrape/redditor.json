The company operates in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control, Rotary and Mission Systems, and Space.\n\n\t\u2022\tThe company reported strong financial results in the second quarter of 2023, with net sales of $16.7 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year, and net earnings of $1.7 billion, or $6.63 per share, an increase of 471% year-over-year. The company also increased its full year outlook for sales, segment operating profit, and earnings per share.\n\n\t\u2022\tThe company has a record backlog of $158 billion, which provides visibility and stability for its future revenue and cash flow. The company\u2019s backlog is driven by its signature programs, such as the F-35 fighter jet, the PAC-3 missile defense system, the GMLRS rocket system, the Orion spacecraft, and the THAAD missile system.\n\n\t\u2022\tThe company faces some competitive and operational challenges, such as the pressure to reduce costs and improve efficiency, the uncertainty of the defense budget and spending priorities, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its supply chain and workforce, and the technological disruption and innovation in the aerospace and defense industry.\n\n\t\u2022\tThe company\u2019s valuation is attractive compared to its peers and historical averages. The company\u2019s stock price is currently trading at $378.45 per share, which implies a price-to-earnings ratio of 14.2 based on its trailing 12-month earnings. This is lower than the industry average of 18.4 and the S&P 500 average of 28.9. The company also pays a dividend yield of 2.8%, which is higher than the industry average of 1.5% and the S&P 500 average of 1.3%\n\n\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "I\u2019m loaded with scwb puts for next week and march 2024, up so far", "LMT has pumped so much already that it's not going to keep pumping unless earnings are stellar", "BAC calls?", "What does after close mean?", "What does call and puts mean?
