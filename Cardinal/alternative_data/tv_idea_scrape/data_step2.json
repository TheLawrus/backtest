If this line of thinking is correct, then this should be a VERY lucrative trade and one I intend to lean into a little harder. I'm watching for a 3 wave retrace into my box and will most likely start buying some more calls. I haven't shopped around yet so if y'all know of a contract with a strike around $25-$30 I'm all ears. Will most likely use a 60-120 day exp. I will update tomorrow as able.   Bonam Fortunam,   --Tyler",

        "text": "Most stocks and indexes had higher than normal volume for the weekly.   Candle technically  wasn't a bullish engulfing because for that to happen  the candle has to open up lower than the previous candle to \"Engulf\" it.   I'm sticking with a bear target of 390 by December. The monthly candle is structure  is still a bearish reversal with 3 black crows; This means a lower low on the monthly is incoming. As we get closer and closer to December  things should start to deteriorate  quickly.   Market goes no where without the tech sectors so let's start with them. You'll  notice that all are at or very near resistance . Still you want to see a rejection/Reversal  with some volume .   XLK   (MSFT/AAPL)   Top of channel here.   Smh   (NVDA/AMD)   XLY   (Tsla/amzn)   I circled the false breakout. This came in Sept after tsla gap up on car sales.   XLC   Meta/googl/Nflx   Back up near supply area .. simple range trade. You don't long these stocks when XLC is near 68   Lastly IXIC or Nasdaq   Simple channel trade here.   Should we break to the upside of all of these sectors from Fridays close  I could see Nasdaq squeezing another 5% to the upside, but I doubt it.   Next , let's look at NYSE which gives a pretty good barometer  of all stocks non tech.   NYSE/NYA   Broadening  wedge formed here.   I think the next leg down starts this week!   Purple line - 50sma   Gold line - 200sma   As you can see , the MA have death crossed.   We stopped right below fib  and moving averages resistance   Instead of DJI , I'm doing DIA this week. Dia is the ETF for dow similar  to how spy works for Spx   DIA   Daily chart   Broadening  wedge here   Looking for the next leg down this week to match NYA move.   IWM   This is a 2D (2day chart,)   Closed at two different trendline  resistance  here.   Over 177 and I'd consider this very bullish. Any thing below 175 is subject to retest 170 minimum   VIX , DXY, 10yr, are all oversold on the hourly which indicates an immediate  bounce  is incoming   VIX support is at 15.00   10yr support at 4.5   Should they drop below these supports , that would be an indicator for me that markets are going alot higher   Spy   I readjusted  my trendline resistance  here.. I felt it legit because of the NYA/DIA structure.   First target here is 430 gap close and trendline support .. entry , below 50sma at 433.60   If we break over 438.70 gap close , then I'd say we are heading towards 445 and then 450.   Just cause a candle has reached resistance  doesn't make it bearish; it just means you shouldn't long this anymore until a breakout. Last 4hours of Friday's close gave us reversal candles on the 4hour charts of the indexes and some sectors. I'd like to see so reversal  candles on the daily chart by Tuesday",

        "text": "Tesla extended up in its last rise if it was indeed a wave (4). It went up and tagged the 1.0 to slightly breach it. This alone makes me really start to doubt that this is wave (4). We did not breach the 0.5 fib retracement though. The question is, was that just to confuse more people. Because as I said we breached the 1.0, penetrated the last wave iv high, made a new high on the 1hr MACD, raised with strength, we have a low on pos div...etc. etc. The reasons are starting to pile up for us having bottomed already. The key is going to be in the structure of this retrace. If it appears as a 5-wave more down and makes a new low, then that is V of C of 2. If we drop in a 3-wave move and end in the yellow box, then 2 is already over and we are headed up in 3 of (3).   If we move up higher yet and it seems impulsive then I will consider us to have bottomed and, on our way up past $300 easily in the not-so-distant future. If you haven't checked out my Rivian posts, I highly suggest you do so. This is starting to resemble that price action and I believe it has more than likely bottomed already. Hopefully it gives us a good chance to get positioned before it takes off without us should this be the case with Tesla.   Bonam Fortunam,   --Tyler",

This signals a high likelihood   MSFT   will hit $345 in the near future:   With a high degree of both bullish and bearish signals, it can be hard to discern where   MSFT   might be headed next.   We are keeping a very close eye on the AVWAP derived from the March 16 event as a guiding factor.  Should the price significantly break below this level, we expect further drawdown to $265 will occur.",

        "text": "Primary Chart   :   DraftKings Inc. Weekly Price Chart with Fibonacci Levels and Downward Trendline from All-Time Highs   DraftKings Inc., an innovative sports-betting company, has been one of the hottest stocks of this week after it beat earnings expectations and raised revenue guidance. Many are likely chasing the stock's price here without any discipline whatsoever, being driven by fear of missing out and the possibility of untold gains from a former darling of growth investors.   The magenta trendline on the primary chart, which is logarithmically scaled by the way, shows that the downtrend remains intact despite today's powerful rally. This downward trendline could be broken, by the way, if momentum is sustained by bullish seasonality and tailwinds into year end in a pre-election year. But a shorter-term down trendline has been decisively snapped with today's upside push, and this suggests near-term strength for DKNG.   Supplementary Chart A   And DKNG gapped above its key 50-day SMA today as well.   Supplementary Chart B   But this post does not recommend shorting or longing this stock; instead, its purpose is to analyze   DKNG   and consider its current position in light of a severe bear market in 2021-2022  and a euphoric bull-market run in 2020-2021. With discipline, some trading profits might be made long or short given this stock's inherent volatilitythe stock rose about 15% today and about 25% this week alone. But without risk management, this stock could easily obliterate anyone attempting to gather quick profits on a short-term to intermediate-term time frame.   The stock is extended here after it gapped above key moving averages. It also has reached critical resistance at the .618 Fibonacci retracement after breaking above the 50% retracement on October 31, 2023.  The .618 Fibonacci retracement lies at $34.25, a few cents above the high of the week and the day today. A bit of consolidation of today's move may provide traders with a bullish view into the new year (a time frame of about 2 months) a reason to buy the dip.   But caution is warranted into 2024 and 2025can technological innovation and earnings surprises be enough to sustain this stock?  Your comments on this particular question are welcome. There may be room for some debate as macro headwinds cannot prevent rallies like the one seen in equity indices like   SPX   and some growth stocks. But there is a decent likelihood that macro headwinds may work against DKNG as long as interest rates remain high and inflation does not disappear. The Federal Reserves funds rate is now at 5.25% to 5.50%, a 22-year high. And quick look at the TradingView's Financial overview shows that DKNG has not had positive net income yet. And its financial history is not that long yet: It was founded in 2011, and it has only been public since 2020. So despite the major earnings beat and positive guidance today, DKNG still lost $0.61 per share. Unprofitable growth stocks do not perform as well in high-rate environments.   ________________________________________   Author's Comment: Thank you for reviewing this post and considering its charts and analysis.

        "text": "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) rose on its most aggressive 1W green candle last week since May 22, as it tested and closed above the 1W MA50 (blue trend-line), which is the long-term Support. This MA level was also tested and held on the week of May 01, which shows that the market has a clear buy zone, despite at times the not so encouraging macro-economics.   Last week's rise also broke above the 5-month Channel Down, which puts it back as a long-term Bull Flag, as it also held the Higher Lows Zone from the October 2022 market bottom.   Perhaps the most important development is the emergence of a Bullish Cross on the 1W MACD, the first since November 14 2022, essentially after a whole year. The minimum rise of AMD's bullish legs since then was +35.24% so we expect this to be fulfilled at $126.00 and then buy the pull-back on the 1D MA50 (red trend-line). With that, we will target $133.15 (Resistance 1). That bullish leg has the potential to test the $164.85 All Time High (ATH) and we will buy it if we close a 1W candle above Resistance 1.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------   ** Please LIKE , FOLLOW , SHARE  and COMMENT  if you enjoy this idea!

Therefore, it is an excellent moment to look at the Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock chart.   On the D1 timeframe, support has formed at 194.67, with resistance at 222.05. Quotes consolidated above the crucial corrective level of 210.41, which may indicate further growth in share prices.   On the H1 timeframe, if there is a rebound from the 222.05 level and the upward trend continues, the short-term target for the price increase can be 234.38.

The thing is though, that the macro story for the core of their business has never been better as demand for natural gas and LNG transfer will only increase as geopolitical tension rises in the Middle East and Russia continues their offensive, all while Biden admin is on track to completely deplete the SPR for the sake of keeping US oil prices stable.   TELL has a huge opportunity to explode here...   Though, they are yet to find a partner to secure FID in the amount of I believe $14.5b for their Driftwood LNG plant in Louisiana. The longer they continue construction without this decision being made, the higher their bankruptcy risk becomes. As soon as they get it, however, investors will pile in money and the impact on price will be monstrous.   Positive developments in FID situation should bring us to dashed line.   Securing of FID could break the uptrend, in an overly optimistic case, and likely over a 1-2 year timeframe.

Since last week, it is staging a rebound sequence as it hit and held (closed 1W candle above it) the 1W MA50 (blue trend-line) which happens to be on top of the 1W MA200 (orange trend-line). Technically that is the bullish leg towards a new Higher High.   However, the last Higher High of the Channel Up was rejected on the Lower Highs trend-line that remains in effect since the November 01 2021 All Time High (ATH), which is essentially the major Resistance of the 2022 Bear Cycle. If it breaks above it, we can expect a Higher High bullish sequence towards $345 at least, since it would represent a +75% rise from last week's bottom (Higher Low), assuming the Higher Highs are on a -$20 decline rate.   Notice also the fair flipped symmetry of the 1W RSI after the January 2023 bottom and the price action before it. If it holds the Support as it held it during the Bear Cycle, we can even see $400 early in Q3 2024.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------   ** Please LIKE , FOLLOW , SHARE  and COMMENT  if you enjoy this idea!

        "text": "Commercial real estate struggled for more than a year as interest rates rose. But now there may be signs of a turn in one of the most actively traded names: New York office-building owner SL Green Realty.   The first pattern on todays chart is the price action on October 31 and November 1. SLG dipped under the previous weeks low on an intraday basis before rebounding. It then jumped to end Friday at its highest level in 12 sessions. The result was a bullish outside week, which can signal an upside reversal.   Second, the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) has been above the 200-day SMA since August. Is the longer-term trend getting more positive?   Third, the recent bounce has left the stock somewhat overbought. Buyers may watch for potential chopping between $32 and $33, which is near the 8-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs).   Speaking of the 8- and 21-day EMAs, the faster EMA is rising toward the slower EMA. (See our   2 MA Ratio   custom script in the lower study.) A potential crossover may signal more bullishness in the near term.   Finally, the bigger issue for SLG could be the macro environment of interest rates. SLG has a large debt load and trades at a discount to book value. It also carries a heavy short interest. Further easing of conditions could make bears think the worst of the crisis has passed and lead them to unwind downside positions.

I am still running my long term short on Nvidia, last week we saw it go sub $400 before rallying back above $450.   In this chart there are 2 lines I'm watching. The first is the newly forming downtrend which it seems to be sticking to at the moment   The second in the strong long term uptrend that's held since Dec 22. That trendline was broken recently and now we are retesting it. I believe that momentum is running out in Nvidia and it's struggling to break Higher highs. That doesn't been we wont see a fake out in the coming week but I'm more inclined to believe that towards the end of the week we start to see Nvidia really falling off. My target for end of week $435 or lower.   My Main Targets for this Trade:   T1 - $373   T2 - $326   T3 - $263   T4 - $203   Once the gap is filled I will place a stop loss in profit and try ride this thing as far down as I can   Thanks for reading, NFA",

However, the volume for the rally was fairly low, with no day in the rally having statistically abnormal volume despite the statistically abnormal returns. This is shown in the NDO indicator, which didn't produce a value above 1 for any of the days in this upswing. Additionally, the macro-economic outlook is still not great, considering how the US debt is rapidly increasing, along with delinquencies. Quoting CNN, \"Subprime auto loan delinquencies are worse now than they were during the financial crisis\" (   Source   ).   Now, the S&P 500 is running into a major area of buyside liquidity, where there was a previous swing high and a unfilled gap down. It is also running into the 100 day moving average which could provide an area of resistance. Additionally, this area has historically previously executed a large amount of volume, as shown in the two volume histograms on the right.   Given the rapid increase in the S&P 500, there is a good chance that there are will profit taking, and lots of stop losses set below the current price. Therefore, algorithmic firms can access significant sell liquidity right now by decreasing prices. With the number of gaps, the market can easily drop quickly if firms do decide to profit off this increased liquidity. The nearest major strong support level would be at the trend channel's support line, where there is significant volume on the 400 day volume histogram, however this is an entire 6% below current prices.   In other words, the market could drop significantly on fairly low volume, so to profit off this situation I will be shorting the market with some puts. The risk reward for this trade is very strong, because in the worst case, this sets the market up for a bearish pennant and a major market crash, and in the best case, it seems as though it will rally only to slightly above the resistance trend line, which is very close to the current prices.",

        "text": "Ah yes... I remember the good ol' days of Square (now known as Block). It was one my best investments in my short career as a trader/investor. Way back when, the story was quite obvious: they had created the best solution for small businesses to sell goods & services either in a store or online.   It was fast and effortless.   The rise of Block, and subsequent drop, has been something to marvel at. I had sold my position many moons ago, but it's remained on my watchlist because I like the company and what it stands for.   Some people have given it a very hard time for its rebranding to Block, its new logo, and mission. However, considering that they are payment experts, I think it's notable and worth watching.   Nevertheless, can the stock really make a comeback? The chart is horrendous.   One factor contributing to this downward trend is the significant acquisition of Afterpay, which required a substantial amount of cash and stock, impacting Block's balance sheet. I still have NO idea why they paid this much to acquire an average company.   I guess the hype and FOMO of BNPL really got to them.   In August 2021, Block announced its intent to acquire Afterpay, a prominent \"buy now, pay later\" fintech company. I think the story made sense - it gave them the capability to add their own credit network. However, the sheer size of the transaction was just bonkers.   Block currently has a market cap of $28 billion. BUT, they acquired AfterPay for $29 billion! Ouch... the company is now worth less than their recent buyout.   It's important to note that such significant acquisitions often take time to yield the intended benefits. The share price decline may be partially attributed to investor impatience and a lack of immediate clarity on how Block plans to integrate Afterpay into its broader ecosystem.   The question is simple: will AfterPay ever yield the payout that Block intended it to have? If the answer is anything but \"yes - it's happening\" there's no reason to trade or invest in this any further. HOWEVER, if there are glimpses that show, just maybe, Block made a smart acquisition, adding a new layer to their payment network that is only just starting, then the return to highs is not far-fetched at all.   The trade is simple: watch to see how Block continues to integrate AfterPay, and, it is starts to work, it's worth evaluating further over 1-3 year comeback in share price.",

        "text": "So, you've realized that Teslas aren't particularly great cars, EVs becoming a worldwide trend is a hoax, and that Elon Musk isn't any kind of very saintly very MAGA saviour of humanity during the end times.   And now that price is down a lot, we want to victory lap and short, because the public relations firms that are running the campaign needed to produce liquidity for banks and big money funds to buy told you to.   The problem with the short Tesla thesis right now is that Musk pledged a significant volume of his shares as collateral to get big money to finance his acquisition of Tweeter, (now known as Xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeter), which by some accounts is worth some painful $15 billion compared to the $45 billion he (they) paid for it.   And so what this means is that there's been significant incentive to sell in the $250 range and buy back lower as a form of risk hedging, with the ultimate purpose of selling higher.   All for the sake of just making all the money without losing any of the money when Xeeeeeeter inevitably goes public in the future because Musk made it the manifest Western form of the Chinese Communist Party's social credit apparatus, WeChat, because Shanghai Gigafactory bro just loves the way the Party does things.   But the risk for bulls, and the economic system alike, is that \"the best laid plans of mice and men oft go awry,\" which is to say that when it comes to gambling on Xi Jinping and his Chinese Communist Party, a fool is a fool.   One should oppose the CCP because it's responsible for the 24-year persecution against Falun Dafa's 100 million practitioners, and the campaign of live organ harvesting genocide that came with it.   Although that campaign was launched, and continued, at the hands of former Chairman Jiang Zemin, and Jiang is dead now, Xi is still the head of the Party, and the first thing you do when slaying a red dragon is sever its head.   Actually, the first thing you do when slaying a red dragon is sever its tail. Former Premier Li Keqiang, who was Xi's right hand man for a lot of years, recently died \"of a heart attack,\" which is likely code for \"was knocked down by Wuhan Pneumonia.\"   If the pandemic in Mainland China is killing the Xi Faction, the world has big time problems.   And it seems to me the recent conflict in Israel and the war that's being launched into Syria and Iran is probably to create a gateway to Mainland China, since Iran connects to Pakistan and Afghanistan, which are already U.S. controlled.   Everyone wants control of China and its 5,000 year history when the CCP finally falls.   So back to Tesla.   The logic is fairly simple.   Because 2023 started uppy, we expect 2023 to finish uppy. We do not expect things that start the beginning of the year on a moon mission to correct into the end of the year, because generally speaking the scam isn't played like that.   Which means that all dips are a dip to buy, and especially when we're finally printing prices under \"$200,\" it's a dip to buy.   But the MMs are the most annoying of the most annoying people and like to run things to lows that are less comfortable. Shipping under $180 from $197 is a further loss of another 10%+, which means options expire worthless/devalue effectively, and everyone is a winner, winner, chicken dinner, except for you, who gets to finance happy hour, strippers, and cocaine at 1:31 p.m. on Halloween Tuesday.   Either way, it's worth expecting the May pivot to hold as a low, a higher low to form, and then we really do see the $320 parade into the end of 2023.   Ho, ho, ho, Happy Santa Rally.   Remember, the Ponzi always continues. By the time the ponzi stops continuing, all the bears will have long since been liquidated. The disaster sequence is when they take down bulltards who buy the dip, buy the dip, and buy the dip as it races towards zero.   And Tesla doesn't have that MULN-style landslide apocalypse pattern. That only happens when big bags are empty and nobody ever buys something again.   So all the price action is just shareholder printer selling.   Yet.",

KEEP IT SIMPLE, REMEMBER, this is not to be exact, this is to create zones to prepare you for future movements based on past gaps)   Why is this useful? Well, if you know a price gap is statistically likely to close, then you can be pretty certain that at some point in the future, that gap will close, meaning price will return to @ or above the price gap.   With this in mind, you can plan ahead and start to realize when your emotions are getting the best of you.   This is also great because you can do this on any time frame with candles.   Why ISNT this useful? Well, this gives you no indication of timing. Past results don't guarantee future results. AND this gives you no indication of current price action. In other words, a GAP could form and close 2 years later, and the entire time before it closes, price keeps going lower and lower.

        "text": "Is TakeTwo Interactive Software Fairly Valued?   We use what is known as a 2 stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.   Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US $9.1b   The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.5%.   The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$27b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$139, the company appears about fair value at a 14% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.   We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Take-Two Interactive Software as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.071. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.   Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

Check out that idea down below.   We have completed the Return Rally back to test Support on the Neckline. Now ive been assessing if there are signs that we continue the Inverse Head and Shoulders with our final explosive breakout move.   This analysis is done on the 1 day timeframe.   As you can see we have tested and CONFIRMED Support on the Neckline.   After doing so we have inched higher.   Notice now, we are ABOVE the 21 EMA.   With the last 3 days of candles, forming LOWER WICKS off the 21 EMA.   This is a great sign of SUPPORT.   We must continue to stay ABOVE the 21 EMA.   Being Above the 21 EMA on any timeframe indicates that we will most likely have an UPTREND in price.   Notice also the Orange Rectangle. This highlights a consolidation zone. This shows to me that we are building up momentum for our final rally of the Inverse Head & Shoulders Pattern.   A confirmation ABOVE the Upper Border of Rectangle, will indicate Rally may be starting.   To keep us on our toes, just remember that if price action goes BELOW the Lower Border of the Rectangle, we risk testing the Neckline again. Which is always a   possibility   . As long as we maintain the Neckline as Support, we good.   Watch VOLUME -> We need it to start picking up for indication of the major move.   This move will essentially lead to trend reversal  for COIN, confirming the bottom.   __________________________________________________________________________________   Thank you for taking the time to read my analysis.

On the stock market today, Uber shares are up 3.8% to 49.90 in recent action. Uber released earnings results Tuesday morning. Third-quarter earnings and fourth-quarter bookings guidance topped estimates. Revenue was short of expectations, however, which the company pinned on accounting changes.   The stock traded lower premarket but has since recovered to post significant gains. Overall, Uber shares have gained more than 90% this year.   Uber Stock: Q3 Earnings Beat, Revenue Light   Early Tuesday, Uber reported third-quarter earnings of 10 cents per share on sales of $9.29 billion for the third quarter ending Sept. 30. Analysts expected Uber to post earnings of 7 cents per share on sales of $9.54 billion, according to FactSet. Some other estimates had called for earnings of 12 cents per share.   In the same quarter last year, Uber lost 61 cents per share on $8.34 billion in revenue.   Total third-quarter bookings climbed 21% year over year to $35.3 billion, compared to expectations of $34.6 billion. Bookings for the Rides business climbed 31% year over year to $17.9 billion. Bookings for the Eats, or delivery, business climbed 18% to $16.1 billion.   Uber routed 2.4 billion trips during the quarter, up 25% from the same period last year.   The 10% revenue gain marked a sixth straight quarter of decelerating sales growth.   However, the company noted that some accounting changes contributed to the lower than expected sales number. Uber Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai said in prepared remarks that the changes reduced revenue by $521 million for the quarter.   Second Straight Operating Profit, Strong Outlook   Uber reported a third-quarter operating income of $394 million, compared to a loss of $495 million last year. The second quarter was Uber's first ever with a profit from its ride-hailing and delivery operations.   Net income for the third quarter was $221 million, recognizing a $96 million headwind that is primarily from unrealized losses on Uber's equity investments.   For the current fourth quarter, Uber projects gross bookings between $36.5 billion and $37.5 billion. Analysts were estimating $36.52 billion. Analysts largely saw positives from the report.   Uber Stock: Relative Strength Hits New High   Uber stock's Relative Strength Rating score is at 96 out of a best-possible 99, indicating it is significantly outperforming the market.   Technical Analysis   Price Momentum   UBER is trading near the top of its 52-week range and above its 200-day simple moving average.   What does this mean?   Investors have been pushing the share price higher, and the stock still appears to have upward momentum. This is a positive sign for the stock's future value.",

        "text": "In my preceeding posts, I'm actually \"bullish\" on equities in the fourth quarter.   SPX ES - Welcome To The Fourth Quarter Rodeo   Nasdaq Futes - You Wanted a Dip For That 'Santa Rally,' Aye?   And while I think this price action, coming on the back of news that the US Treasury will \"only\" issue $10 billion more worth of bonds this quarter (compared to like $160 billion last quarter), indicates that not only are we bullish, but going to take out the all time highs before year end...   I have reservations on this SPECIFIC price action being \"The Bottom\".   Before we go further, I will use the early space for those with low attention spans to warn you about the situation in Mainland China.   The Chinese Communist Party is the scourge of humanity that seeks to use all beings to destroy all beings. Xi Jinping is its head, and the Party will fall. When you kill a dragon, you kill it by chopping of its head.   But before you chop off its head, you often cripple it by chopping its tail. Former Xi Premier and right hand man Li Keqiang was killed by \"a heart attack\" recently, which is almost certainly code for the \"Wuhan Pneumonia Pandemic.\"   The Party's 24-year persecution, and organ harvesting genocide, against Falun Dafa's 100 million practitioners is a sin that 100.00% guarantees the Party's destruction.   And that means it guarantees Xi's destruction, so long as he doesn't drop the CCP Gorbachev-style in time.   It does not look like Xi is that intelligent of a man to do that.   And so whatever bullish nonsense is arranged by Wall Street, who frequently sleeps with and transfuses blood to the Jiang Faction of the CCP, who are the architects of Falun Gong's persecution and the real evil force behind the Party and \"China,\" to make sure that Communism globally can stay alive until the ruthless end, is subject to abject, merciless, brutal, and sudden truncation.   Meaning any rally can be annihilated by international events that are beyond the control of the so-called \"controllers\" at any time, for we fundamentally exist in a Cosmos that is inherently Divine.   There's some flaws on the SPY ETF, which is meaningful, because as I say many times, life revolves around banks and funds selling options and making sure they expire worthless.   When we look at the monthly:   October took out the June low, as I predicted earlier, but came up like a dollar shy of entering into the April wick.   Moreover, when we look at the weekly:   Which shows us more clearly the April-May double bottom is just 1%~ lower than the October low, and the $400 psych level is just 2% lower.   With this kind of a squeeze happening only 3 trading days into November's candle, and failing to take the high, we're primed to set up for an \"outside bar\" November that takes out BOTH the low AND the high of October.   But what this would mean is we're about to dump below the October low, where the real buying opportunity is.   But two problems with the theory are:   1) There's no news drivers next week except for Jerome Powell talking on Thursday.   2) The bull thesis has to complete by December 31 and we're running out of time   But that being said, when we had the October bottom last year, we had a 3-day 6% rally to open October before it turned around and took out the low and then rallied.   And when we had the COVID bottom because the Fed slashed rates to zero and started buying equities, the market had a 10% rally over the course of a few weeks and gave almost all of it back before setting the biggest highs of all time.   So this kind of manipulative behaviour is consistent with the market makers.   How to trade it? Well, if it doesn't go down next week then just blindly long anywhere and so long as you aren't buying calls with 0 or 3 days to expiry, you should be okay.   If it does go down, buy near the October low and under the October low.   The problem is no short setup has manifested as of Friday close, and so we can only sit on the sidelines and look for longs. Whoever was bigly long from Monday or last week should really have taken significant money off the table, cashing in and realizing those gains, this afternoon.   Don't forget the Dollar Index stopped just short of $108 and that's a big sign of coming manipulation and that we're too early.   This is how algorithms are programmed.   Good luck.",

Net income for the quarter was $48.1 million, a 75.0% increase compared to the prior year quarter.   AAON's backlog at the end of Q3 2023 was $490.6 million, down 4.7% from $514.7 million a year ago.   AAON Inc (NASDAQ:AAON), a leading provider of HVAC solutions, announced its third-quarter results for 2023 on November 6, 2023. The company reported record net sales and gross profits for the second consecutive quarter, with all three segments performing well. The AAON Oklahoma and BASX segments saw robust double-digit organic net sales growth and record gross profits, while the AAON Coil Products segment recorded its highest profits over the last four quarters.   Financial Highlights   Net sales for the third quarter of 2023 increased by 28.6% to $312.0 million, up from $242.6 million in the third quarter of 2022. This marks the seventh straight quarter of record sales in the company's history. The gross profit margin for the quarter increased to 37.2%, up from 27.0% in the same quarter in 2022 and up from 33.1% in the previous quarter. Net income for the quarter was $48.1 million, an increase of $20.6 million or 75.0% compared to the prior year quarter.   Performance Analysis   AAON's strong performance in the third quarter was driven by improved productivity across all three segments, incremental pricing, and improved overhead absorption. The company's manufacturing teams improved the efficiency of operations while continuing to add production capacity. Supply chain disruptions, which had been a concern in previous quarters, continued to abate, contributing to the rising production rates.   Backlog and Future Outlook   The company finished the third quarter of 2023 with a backlog of $490.6 million, down 4.7% from $514.7 million a year ago, and down from $526.2 million at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Despite the decrease in backlog, AAON remains optimistic about the future. The company anticipates that upcoming new refrigerant regulations will disrupt the industry in 2024, which AAON views as a positive opportunity to gain market share.   Financial Position   As of September 30, 2023, the company had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $22.5 million and a balance of $78.4 million on the revolving credit facility. The company's balance sheet remains strong with a current ratio of 3.0 and a leverage ratio of 0.33.   Price Momentum   AAON is trading in the middle of its 52-week range and near its 200-day simple moving average.   What does this mean?   Investors are still evaluating the share price, and the stock is still trying to generate some momentum. This is a Positive sign for the stock's future value.",

        "text": "Fundamentals   Snowflake (SNOW) sells data analytics and management software that runs on cloud computing platforms. The company is evolving into a cloud data management platform.   SNOW stock is up 4% in 2023 after pulling back from bigger gains. The Nasdaq composite has jumped 29% amid buzz over generative artificial intelligence.   The company offers Snowflake Cortex, a new fully-managed service to provide access to large language models, AI models and vector search functionality.   When the company reported April-quarter earnings, Snowflake cut its full-year fiscal 2024 outlook. Snowflake lowered its forecast for product revenue growth to 34% to $2.6 billion from its earlier projection for 44% to 45% growth.   SNOW stock could get a boost from a recent multi-year expansion of its partnership with Amazon Web Services. Both companies will contribute to stepped-up marketing.   Snowflake has committed $2.5 billion in spending on AWS over the next five years as part of the deal. The two companies will expand strategic initiatives by developing industry solutions, deepening product integrations, increasing sales collaboration, and expanding marketing strategies. Snowflake and AWS currently have over 6,000 joint customers. About 84% of Snowflake customers run cloud workloads on AWS.   SNOW Stock: Biggest Software IPO   Because Snowflake's business model is consumption-based rather than subscription-based, bearish investors have raised concerns over a possible U.S. recession curbing demand.   Snowflake aims to enable customers to access and distribute data across their business ecosystem, thereby accelerating business intelligence and advanced analytics.   Snowflake stock pulled off the largest initial public offering ever by a software company in September 2020. The Snowflake IPO raised $3.4 billion.   Snowflake hosted a user conference and analyst day in Las Vegas in June 2022. The company said new products in app development, data security and other areas will expand its total addressable market to $248 billion by 2027, up from $90 billion last year.   Snowflake Stock: Consumption Business Model   Most software stocks typically trade as a multiple of forward-looking revenue growth. Snowflake is not a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, company that aims to build recurring subscription revenue.   At the user event, the company addressed concern over its consumption-based revenue business model. Snowflake revenue is tied to how much data its customers crunch and store. One issue is that usage could slow during a recession.   Another issue is that customers view Snowflake as expensive if they don't control usage. Some analysts say there's less transparency and predictability than with a subscription-based SaaS business model.   Snowflake Stock: Competition Increasing   Further, Snowflake stock hit an all-time high of 429 in early December of 2020. But SNOW stock swooned amid analyst concerns over its lofty valuation.   Competition is increasing. Salesforce (CRM) recently introduced Genie, a real-time data solution, that could clash with Snowflake at some point.   Whether Amazon Web Services or Google cloud ratchet up competition remains a concern for SNOW stock. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), with its GreenLake platform, is another rival.   Technical Analysis   We can see a Horizontal Trend Line forming a Head and Shoulder In Snow Inc. meaning the Stock is likely to swingle in-between the support and Resistance Zone Respectively.   Price Momentum   SNOW is trading in the middle of its 52-week range and below its 200-day simple moving   average. Investors are still evaluating the share price, but the stock still appears to have some downward momentum.",

All I know is major social, political, geopolitical, financial and economic events will take place to execute this Distribution Schematic all the way to our Sign of Weakness events in Phase E.   The globalist in the WEF, UN, NATO, US, IMF, BIS, etc... know their FIAT monetary scam is coming to its end.  They are desperately attempting to avoid more people waking up to their plans to control all of us.  What better way to control us than to diminish our food supply, bankrupt all of us with a collapse supposedly caused by events THEY CREATED.   What's the \"main\" purpose of creating these events and why so desperate to carry them out as soon as possible?  Well, the FIAT Central Banking System is approaching its end due to inflation.  So, they need multiple distractions (events) to take place in order to have SOMETHING to blame the collapse of their system.  They don't want people blaming \"them\" for this collapse.   Many of you are already awake.  Some of you still must walk through the darkness before you finally see the light.  We (as human beings) are still DIVIDED by propaganda these globalist propagate.  But that's okay... Soon, we (Republican, Democrat, Independent) will be united.  AT least most of us.  Why?  Well, when everyone's ability to put food on the table, pay rent/mortgage, put gas in the car, etc... is affected to the point of putting many into despair, we will finally unite to rid this world of those who seek to control all of us in an effort to gratify themselves.   There are dark dark times ahead.  Unfortunately, we must go through these dark times to avoid a major civil war between us all.  To avoid needless bloodshed.  It had to be done this way to wake many up who have been sleeping and unite us all for a common best good for all humanity.   I look forward to that day most all of us are finally united for the best good of all.  Until then, prepare and plan well for what's to come.  And most importantly, Stay Awesome!   David",

I expect November to be mainly chop since the current move has been so quick - a good time for scalping the market. I do not have a turning date decided yet, nor a precise price level (as I have shown in past charts on shorter timefreames). Generally, if you look back at the monthly chart, every major top has generated an inverse cup and handle pattern in the downtrend (clearing early shorts in a very aggressive manner).

My previous trade is still running and the old chart can be found under my idea, everything is still valid in that chart.   I decided to make a new chart, as there's been some big moves recently on Nvidia.   I have two trend lines on this chart, the first is the short term trend which broke a couple days ago and the second is the main one to watch.   The main trend  starts from Jan 06 2023, this trend has held well and is drawn on the daily time frame. Last time we came back to revisit this trend it bounced and pushed back towards 480. Now we are back at this trend and on the hourly we have broken through, we have not yet broken it on the daily which is our main timeframe to watch the trend on. Breaking in on the hourly I believe is an early indication of what's to come. When we break this on the Daily timeframe I believe Nvidia will head towards sub $400, at this level the bears will take over and I can't see Bulls fighting back and winning.   Targets:   T1- $406   T2 - $373   T3 $326 ($373 & $326 would fill the gap)   Target 3 - $263   Target 4 - $203   At Target 2 Stop Losses will be placed in profit and will attempt to ride Nvidia down as far as I can.",

SPY   SPY - Did We Bottom, Or Is Manipulation Coming?   And Tesla   Tesla - Remember, The Ponzi Always Continues   Which generally have a bullish-into-year-end thesis accompanying them, but caution that an October bottom for the second year in a row and a mega three day rally to start November may be something of a trap.   When it comes to Apple, we have reservations that we topped under $200, for really obvious reasons, especially considering that on the monthly, the last three months of bearish price action haven't been that bearish.   Yet, because the weekly shows us that there are two bars under $150 and $140 from last year that never printed a low, that those areas are probably protected until Apple starts to seriously deflate and enter an end-of-life cycle bear market.   If Apple is going to enter an end of life cycle bear market, the MMs will 100% take out the $200 range and sell everything there first.   So, fundamentally, why would Apple be at the end of its life? The answer is simple: the company, all these years, wed itself to the Chinese Communist Party, which is the scourge of humanity, The Beast, and the benefactor to Babylon (Shanghai).   There's lots of really horrific data involving Apple numbers and the Chinese market right now, and the CCP under Xi Jinping is also rushing to replace other phone companies with domestic product, like the notorious Huawei.   The elephant in the room when it comes to cellular and computer purchases in China is that they're down because there are less people in China as a result of the enormous damage the novel pneumonia pandemic that originated in Wuhan City has caused.   SARS 1 in 2003 was covered up by the Party. The CCP made it seem like only a few thousand people died, when in reality, some accounts have stated that several million people died.   Today, the Party still claims that less than 122,000 people died from COVID-19, despite China being the epicentre of the disease.   You don't need an expert, or even a calculator, to figure out what's really going on and why the Chinese economy is in trouble.   What's at stake for Xi and his faction is the 24-year-long organ harvesting genocide and persecution against Falun Dafa's 100 million practitioners.   Although Xi has not participated in the persecution, and has, to the contrary, been killing via his Anti-corruption Campaign the Jiang Zemin faction who started and maintained the persecution all these years, the problem is that Xi is the head of the Party.   When you kill a dragon, you decapitate it. But first, you start with its tail. And it's telling that former Premier Li Keqiang died a few weeks ago, merely in his 60s, at the hands of \"an heart attack.\"   So the fundamentals on Apple are bad because of China. So, with great faith in the principle of reversed logic, we actually look for longs with the chance to sell over $200.   But the charts, as they stand, are not giving us a long signal.   Everything, including Apple, bounced so hard in the first three days of November, and for Apple this came on the back of an earnings report, that we have to view the situation with major reservations, expecting that the candle painting of the low for the monthly bar has not yet been completed.   Last October, Apple pretended to bottom, pretended to double bottom in November, and then gave it all back and set the low of the year at the end of 2022, and all of this happened while the indexes had properly bottomed in October.   There was none of that \"Magnificent 7\" talk back then.   So, how to trade this? I think it's wiser to go long on a breakout over $183 in a size that allows you to take partials at $198, $205, and $215 than it is to have bought in the last three days.   And if we do dump, where we're looking for reversal patterns is at or below the April of 2022 low at $159.80~.   But if we're about to moon for manipulation, we're actually likely to see a sweep just below the current November low of $167.90.   So long as you can buy there without getting expired worthless on some short dated options, you'll have the best chance to ride the manipulation wave.   But be careful. When it's time for the CCP to fall, all the bigger dominoes go with it, because they're all really lesser dominoes.   Gap down overnight because of the time difference between Beijing and Manhattan means margin calls that scale in brutality, because Wall Street won't be in the mood to go risk on anything ever again.   Nor will it have the money or the breath to.",

As expected, it got rejected, also bumping into the 200 SMA (4hr)with a huge rejection, confirming it is still in a strong bear-trend now. We are also way below on the 200day SMA, and also the 200week SMA.   On the weekly, we are loosing momentum, but some upside is expected on the short-term.   I assume (but price actions will tell), this short term uptrend will help to finish the smaller formation on the new Head and Shoulders, which I highlighted with paintbrush in white.

Today, we are starting to approach some extremely critical support zones towards the 2008 recession price point.   I have been considering 2 buy in zones at $88 and potentially a capitulation to $82 (if it even gets that low).   We are still waiting to hear from Powell in regards to further rate hikes, and the market is currently expecting one more hike with no real major cuts for 2024.   I will be looking out for the following statement during the next FOMC:   Powell decides to raise one more time according to the Dot Plot, however state that the comity has reached their goal of sufficiently restrictive territory with no more further rate hikes.   However, he will be adamant that rates will remain higher for longer, and the Fed will monitor live data to make future decisions.   This may be the mark of the bottom for TLT where I will start accumulating.",

        "text": "In the past 2 months, XPO Logistics's stock price has experienced a decline. However, there are certain indicators that suggest a potential opportunity for investors to buy the stock. This trading idea is based on the provided facts and aims to take advantage of the stock's price appreciation potential and high trading volume.   Strategy   The trading idea revolves around two key factors:   High Trading Volume: XPO Logistics, Inc.'s daily trading volume spiked by 367% in the previous session. This indicates increased market activity and interest in the stock. Higher trading volume often suggests greater liquidity and can potentially lead to price volatility, providing opportunities for traders to profit.   Price Performance: Despite the recent decline, XPO Logistics's stock price has moved up by 30% since the beginning of the year. This indicates a positive price trend and potential for further growth.   Core Logic   The core logic behind this trading idea is to identify stocks that have shown substantial price appreciation and high trading volume. By targeting such stocks, investors can potentially benefit from short-term price movements and capitalize on market momentum.   Technical Outlook   The MACD analysis for XPO Logistics (XPO) indicates that the stock is entering a bullish phase. The price action has crossed above its signal line, suggesting an upcoming boost in bullish sentiment. This analysis provides valuable insights for traders and investors looking to capitalize on potential price movements.   In the past five days, XPO Logistics has experienced a drop in its stock price. However, it has outperformed the Nasdaq by an impressive 264.85% so far this year. With a market cap of $8.99 billion, XPO Logistics remains a significant player in the stock market.   Yesterday, XPO Logistics saw a surge in trading volume, with 6.23 million shares traded, which is 367% higher than the average. Traders are now closely monitoring the stock's movement as it approaches its opening price of $73.24.   Furthermore, XPO Logistics broke through a key Fibonacci resistance level at $70.56, and since then, its price has continued to rise. This breakthrough indicates a strong bullish sentiment in the market.   In a positive session, XPO Logistics gained $10.15, or 15.08%, according to technical analysis. Despite this significant increase, the stock is currently rated as \"Neutral\" based on this analysis.   In comparison, some other stocks also experienced positive movements in yesterday's session. United Parcel Service (UPS) added 2.93%, General Electric (GE) saw a 3.25% increase, and Union Pacific (UNP) surged from 201.72 to 205.8.   Based on the MACD analysis and the recent price movements, XPO Logistics appears to have bullish potential. Traders and investors should closely monitor the stock for further developments.   Conclusion   Considering the provided facts, the trading idea is to buy XPO Logistics, Inc. (XPO) stock. However, it is important to note that this strategy is suitable for investors with a moderately short investment horizon and a high risk tolerance. As always, it is recommended to conduct further research and analysis before making any investment decisions.",

        "text": "The share price of Wipro (WIT) has declined by around 6.88% in the past month. This short trade idea focuses on selling the asset, based on the following strategy:   12-day exponential moving average (EMA) below 26-day EMA: This strategy seeks out assets where the 12-day EMA is below the 26-day EMA. This indicates a potential bearish trend and suggests that the price may continue to decline in the near term.   Significant support levels: The asset should also have significant support levels that can serve as profit targets. These support levels act as price levels where buying interest is expected to outweigh selling pressure, potentially causing the price to bounce back.   By selling the asset, traders can aim to profit from the expected downward movement in the share price. However, it's important to note that this strategy carries a somewhat high risk tolerance and is suitable for a short investment horizon.   Please note that this trade idea is based on the provided facts and does not take into account any additional information or analysis. Traders should conduct their own research and analysis before making any investment decisions.   Technical Outlook   Technical Analysis: Wipro Approaching Key Support at $4.5   Wipro's stock (WIT) is currently approaching a key support level, just 10 cents away from 4.5. The stock's price action is crucial at this level, as dropping below it could indicate further losses ahead. On the other hand, a failure to break below 4.5 could be viewed positively by market bulls, potentially leading to a retracement.   Yesterday, Wipro's stock formed a \"Bearish Harami\" chart pattern, signaling impending bearish sentiment. This, combined with the ongoing downtrend, suggests that the stock's downward movement is likely to continue.   In the past 5 days, Wipro has appreciated by 1.32%. The stock is currently trading with a market cap of $23.99 billion. Yesterday, there were 960,788 shares traded, which is below the average of 1.73 million shares.   Wipro's immediate support level is around 4.57, while its resistance level is at 4.62. These levels will be important to watch as the stock's price action unfolds.   In comparison to other themed assets, Texas Instruments closed yesterday with a 1.82% drop, Apple saw a rise to 179.23 from 176.65, and Microsoft was up 1.06%.   Overall, Wipro's stock is at a critical juncture, and its ability to hold above or break below the $4.5 support level will be key in determining its future direction.",

It was late in the afternoon the probabilities of the weekly candle closing at the high were really small.

The Bearish bet here is Not that we reach a new lower low below 410, but that the 2nd term seller returns at +1 sig in the Blue band just enough to get through 12/15 expiration. Short strike is back at +3 sig and I think it's a good trade a ceiling holds here and pushes back down into 425 or so. At which point I'll look to sell 393 Puts if it happens.

Our goal is to find a low support point and enter. It can be referred to as buying at the pullback point. The pullback point can be found with a Fibonacci extension of 61.80%. This is a step to find entry level. 1) Find a triangle (Fibonacci Speed Fan Line) that connects the high (resistance) and low (support) points of the stock in progress, where it is continuously expressed as a Slingshot, 2) and create a Fibonacci extension level for the first rising wave from the start point of slingshot pattern.   When the current price goes over 61.80% level , that can be a good entry point, especially if the SMA 100 and 200 curves are gathered together at 61.80%, it is a very good entry point.   As a great help, tradingview provide these Fibonacci speed fan lines and extension levels with ease. So if you use the Fibonacci fan line, the extension level, and the SMA 100/200 curve well, you can find an entry point for the stock market. At least you have to enter at this low point to avoid trading failure, and if you are skilled at entering this low point, with fibonacci6180 technique, your reading skill to chart will be greatly improved.   If you want to do day trading, please set the time frame to 5 minutes or 15 minutes, and you will see many of the low point of rising stocks.

I also wanted to see what the frequency of monied covered call random call away of shares was; most literature suggests early, random assignment is somewhat rare (around 7%) but there isn't much information out there in addition to that, such as when the highest likelihood of early exercise is (it's most likely when the extrinsic value in the call is de minimus) or how deeply monied the call is (which is related to how much extrinsic is left in the long call that the other person would be exercising; deeper in-the-money options have less extrinsic in them relative to less monied options of the same duration).  This could naturally give the setup a slight edge over a short put, since an early exercise by a counter-party would result in max profit without having to wait until all the extrinsic has leaked out of the monied short call.",

The cybersecurity sector is rallying on the back of   geopolitical tensions   and some stocks, like   CYBR   have put some lovely technical setups   The fundamentals here are not as pristine as in the case of   QLYS   , but they are still   robust   The revenue growth is strong and has remained robust and consistent; the sales have grown nearly   1500%   in the past decade, from 47m to $700m   The company has a healthy balance sheet with a reasonable level of debt   The valuation is   elevated   , but that is to be expected for stocks with a lot of momentum. However, here I am attracted more to the technical setup   Technicals   Anyone who has seen my other trade ideas knows that a solid base with a high-volume breakout is a vital part of my analysis. Here, we have a base which has been forming over a   three-year period   . Usually, the longer the period, the more robust the base.   Last week, the base broke on a release of   strong earnings   followed by a higher-than-average volume, and most importantly, we have seen follow-through in price, suggesting the breakout likely has legs   Other indicators suggest   continuing momentum   and the overall sector is also remaining strong and in support of the rally   Trade   The price is a bit far off from the breakout point, so it currently does not offer the most ideal entry point. I would probably suggest waiting for   a pullback or at least a consolidation   as the stock is slightly extended on the daily.   However, for someone with a more   long-term outlook   , this price represents an entry as good as any   Suggested   stop-loss   is at the breakout point. A caveat would be if the stock fell back and through the breakout point.   One should also watch for the performance of the   overall industry   . For that, I can recommend the cybersecurity ETF   HACK   Follow me for more analysis & Feel free to ask any questions you have, I am happy to help   If you like my content,   Please leave a like, comment or a donation   , it motivates me to keep producing ideas, thank you :)",

        "text": "Block Inc (SQ) is showing signs of a bullish reversal on the monthly chart, as it displays a divergence between the price and three momentum indicators: RSI, MOM and OBV.   The price of SQ has been making lower highs and lower lows, forming a descending channel pattern. However, the RSI, MOM and OBV indicators have been making higher lows, indicating that the selling pressure is weakening and that the buyers are gaining strength.   The RSI measures the momentum of the price movement, and a divergence occurs when the RSI moves in the opposite direction of the price. The RSI has been rising from 32.77 in July 2022 to 46.01 in October 2023, while the price has been falling from $75.23 to $48.68 in the same period. This suggests that the downward momentum is slowing down and that a reversal may be possible.   The MOM measures the rate of change of the price, and a divergence occurs when the MOM moves in the opposite direction of the price. The MOM has been rising from -19.23 in July 2022 to -1.69 in October 2023, while the price has been falling from $75.23 to $48.68 in the same period. This indicates that the rate of decline is decreasing and that a turnaround may be imminent.   The OBV measures the positive and negative flow of volume in a security over time, and a divergence occurs when the OBV moves in the opposite direction of the price. The OBV has been rising from 1.16B in July 2022 to 1.25B in October 2023, while the price has been falling from $75.23 to $48.68 in the same period. This implies that there is more accumulation than distribution of shares and that the demand is increasing.   All these indicators suggest that the stock may have bottomed and that a new uptrend may begin. However, the stock may face some resistance at the 200-week moving average, which is currently around $65. The stock may also experience some volatility and corrections along the way, as the market conditions and investor sentiment may change. Therefore, I would still be cautious and flexible, and use stop-loss orders and risk management techniques to protect my capital and limit my losses in case the stock does not behave as expected.",

However this one formed after a steep drop down, so one could add a pole and call this a pennant.   The targets for Pennants and Flags are calculated using the pole.  The structure at the end of the pole can not go on and on or it becomes \"too heavy\" for the pole to support.  Both come in bullish and bearish forms and they both slope against the prevailing trend but can be flat.  A flag should, but not always, takes 3 weeks to form at a minimum and the lines slope parallel to each other.  A bull Flag or Pennant often slopes down against the prevailing uptrend and a bear Pennant or Flag often slopes up against the prevailing downtrend.  Both are neutral until broken and can break up or down.   There is no such thing as a Bullish Rising Wedge although they do break up sometimes as MSFT has done recently.  The bottom line is eventually broken but these can be long term patterns and are not valid until the bottom line is broken.  Rising Wedges cause an imbalance between supply and demand (too many buyers within the wedge) and can be caused by FOMO.  When price breaks the bottom line there tends to be a sell off to balance supply and demand once again.   Rising wedges are just about impossible for me to establish a target for and they usually do fall but a level of support within the wedge can catch price and stop the fall even if temporarily.   Both Rising wedges and Bear Pennants have the possibility of breaking to the upside especially as of late in this market that feels a bit strange to me. We are all different.   Flags, pennants and rising wedges are neutral until a line is broken.   There is also a cup trying to form but price is a ways from EL for this pattern.   No recommendation.

The company is slated to report its fiscal second-quarter 2024 earnings after the bell.   Take-Two has suggested it could launch in 2024. The company in May said it will enter its next phase of growth in fiscal 2025, which begins in April 2024, as it plans to deliver several groundbreaking titles that we anticipate will set new standards of quality and success and enable us to deliver over $8 billion in Net Bookings and over $1 billion in Adjusted Unrestricted Operating Cash Flow.   GTA V was announced in 2011 and released in 2013. It remains popular 10 years later.   The current release of the game, Grand Theft Auto V, is the second best-selling game of all time by units sold after Microsoft   -subsidiary Mojangs Minecraft. Its developed by Take-Two subsidiary Rockstar. Rockstars franchises, which include Grand Theft Auto but also Red Dead Redemption, have helped fuel Take-Twos share price growth and $23.16 billion market cap.   Earlier this year, the company signaled that 2024 and beyond would be a significant period for the company.   Investors and consumers alike have long awaited the release of the next Grand Theft Auto game. GTA V was lauded for its graphics and playing style, and to this day continues to contribute ongoing revenue to Take-Two through its online platform.   In August, when the company reported its fiscal 2024 first-quarter earnings, total net bookings grew 20% year over year to $1.20 billion. Among the largest contributors, the company said in a release, were Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V.

However, while it maintained its outlook for full-year earnings, it lowered its revenue expectations due to challenges in North America, its biggest market, during the back half of the year.   For the three months to September 30, 2023, the company posted flat revenue of $1.6 billion as revenue increases in EMEA and the Asia Pacific region made up for declines in North America and Latin America.   Revenue from apparel and accessories rose, compensating for a decline in footwear revenue. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) rose 26% to $0.24.   The company has guided for full-year 2024 revenue to be 2% to 4% down versus its previous expectation of flight to slightly higher.   However, it expects a gross margin of 100 to 125 basis points against its previous guidance of 25 to 75 basis points.   It still expects to achieve diluted EPS of between $0.47 and $0.51.

DKNG is approaching the C wave of this Crab Pattern. This is the wave were the action either begins or ends. In this case its just starting. I am seeing an intermediate Crab pattern (shown in yellow). This pattern expected to check up and break down to 26.00 (purple line) and consolidate in this area before it breaks out. Once above 30 dollars it will not stop until the 40 goal is reached. This move is confirmed by the previous pattern which still has not run its course (shown in blue) and also terminates at this same location. DKNG has done good, but if you are not in - wait for the pull back to 26 and then you can merely wait for the profits. Anything dramatically lower than 26 is dead and the move up will need to recover (if at all). Expect 24-25 to be possible shake out price levels, but the move back up is expected to be swift.. so plan wisely if not already in.",

Its been my experience these patterns typically have the deep retracement and then rally back upside. They can be fast going up and then dramatically deceiving and slow coming down. The pattern terminates 37.55 , but the Gann box is at 40.. so I am suspecting (without confirmation at this time) that a new mico bullish harmonic will develop at the APEX. Thsi is also near the 3/1 Gann angle and usually is a strong terminating or promoting area. In this case I think this pattern will draw in late comers and then the dramatic drop in price will commence, but 40 remains the target until we can get additional information later in this cycle.

I generally would stay away from a company/stock like Carvana, as potentially bankrupt-bound companies are not what I like to trade. But I couldn't help but realize the Cup & Handle being formed on the weekly chart currently. Below are some highlights of what I find attractive in the technical layout of this setup:   - Weekly Inverse Head & Shoulders / Cup & Handle   - Momentum is leaning bullish (TTM_SQUEEZE)   - Bought up from $20 demand zone   - Daily Chart has ema cloud bounce   - Decent Volume Accumulation   Limits to this / confirmation needed:   - Weekly ema cloud testing key area   - Monthly Ema Cloud key level as well   Closing Notes: I do believe that this technical setup is very strong. I also like that not many of the fundamentals & catalysts will likely play into this as Q3 Earnings just reported. This ER also swung a profit in EPS, and sent a pop in the stock adding to some positive sentiment surrounding   CVNA   Overall I am looking to go long on a bullish retest of some sort and wanted to share a setup I have not seen in a while!",

From an elliott wave perspective I have 2 scenarios, where scenario one assumes we have already bottomed in the consolidation zone down around 1 USD. (Even if we have not bottomed, we gonna get a bigger ABC-or WXY correction possibly reaching at least the 1:1 target).   It is possible (but not guaranteed) we have put in the first subwave 1 as a leading diagonal (expanding rising wedge), where we have moved in 3 counts in each wave as an abc (watch for extended trading hours!!!).   We could argue where is the white wave 1 top - either we had an overshooting b wave and the yellow c wave already bottomed as well (possible), OR the b wave currently forming and will followed by the yellow c wave down, but keeping the higher low overall.   I am scaling in slowly on the pullbacks for now with the stoploss just under 1.00 USD. Since it is a leading diagonal at best, we cannot really trust it until it proves itself. I am waiting to see a more defined abc pullback structure for now, support areas are added.   Overall we have just danced around the 200day MA, 180day MA provided support, all the other moving averages (9/21/50) are below us, in case pullback coming possibly giving as more support. Daily RSI and MACD turning upside, selloff slowing down, and about to diverge (already in convergence). Weekly datas getting stronger (RSI/MACD), and currently we are above the defined baseline, which will also possibly provide support on pullbacks. Whoever like formations, seemingly we are forming a bigger falling wedge (bullish), even is the lows not in YET (then it is quiet near probably). Also, it is not uncommon that if wave 2 have finished and starting/started the white wave 3, will form some kind of inverse head and shoulders, watch for that as a little confirmation (still not guarantee).   Overall I think it has a good chance now to bottom and start an upside cycle.",

        "text": "After releasing disappointing Q2 earnings, Roblox (NYSE: RBLX) plummeted by as much as 34% reaching new 52-week lows. While the stock has rebounded since by 37%, this rebound may be short-lived as the gaming platforms Q3 earnings are right around the corner on November 8th pre-market. Analysts are estimating the company to report $829.8 million in bookings while posting an EPS of -$0.495. While the model used in this article forecasts the company to beat the bookings estimate, it projects it to report a wider loss due to the constant growth of its R&D costs. Moreover, the gaming platform is showing signs of struggling to monetize its daily average users (DAU) due to its declining bookings per DAU, a trend the model expects to persist in Q3. With the stock seemingly trading at a premium compared to other players in the gaming industry, taking a short position in RBLX stock may be lucrative ahead of its earnings.   RBLX Fundamentals   Q3 Forecast   In order to forecast RBLXs revenue, we have to forecast its DAUs first. With that in mind, the companys DAUs have historically increased in the years second half compared to the first half. As such, we can forecast its Q3 DAU to be more than 72.1 million based on the average QoQ growth rate of 10.17% from Q2 to Q3 in 2020, 2021, and 2022.   Quarter\tDAUs\tQoQ Growth   Q2 20\t33,400,000   Q3 20\t36,200,000\t8.38%   Q2 21\t43,200,000   Q3 21\t47,300,000\t9.49%   Q2 22\t52,200,000   Q3 22\t58,800,000\t12.64%   Q2 23\t65,500,000   Q3 23\t72,163,021\t10.17%   After forecasting Robloxs Q3 DAUs, we can now calculate its revenue per user to find its revenue projection. Since Q1 2021, the companys revenue per DAU has been ranging between $9  $11. Therefore, we can use the average revenue per user over that period of $10.22 to reach a revenue projection of $737.3 million.   Quarter\tDAU\tRevenue\tRevenue/DAU   Q1 21\t42,100,000\t$386,976,000\t$9.19   Q2 21\t43,200,000\t$454,100,000\t$10.51   Q3 21\t47,300,000\t$509,336,000\t$10.77   Q4 21\t49,500,000\t$568,769,000\t$11.49   Q1 22\t54,100,000\t$537,134,000\t$9.93   Q2 22\t52,200,000\t$591,207,000\t$11.33   Q3 22\t58,800,000\t$517,707,000\t$8.80   Q4 22\t58,800,000\t$579,004,000\t$9.85   Q1 23\t66,100,000\t$655,344,000\t$9.91   Q2 23\t65,500,000\t$680,766,000\t$10.39   Q3 23\t72,163,021\t$737,329,905\t$10.22   Using the same method we can also project Robloxs bookings in Q3 which is the metric the company mainly focuses on. After pandemic restrictions started to be lifted in 2022, Robloxs bookings per DAU declined substantially as life returned to normal  declining from $15.56 in Q4 2021 to $11.67 in Q1 2022. Since then, bookings per DAU have roamed around $12 except in Q4 2022 where the gaming platform reported record bookings.   Based on this, we can use the average bookings per DAU since Q1 2022 except Q4 2022 since it is an outlier. In this way, the companys bookings per DAU can be estimated to be $11.9 which amounts to bookings of $858.5 million, more than analysts estimate of $829.85 million by 3.4%.   Quarter\tDAU\tBookings\tBookings/DAU   Q1 22\t54,100,000\t$631,200,000\t$11.67   Q2 22\t52,200,000\t$639,900,000\t$12.26   Q3 22\t58,800,000\t$701,700,000\t$11.93   Q4 22\t58,800,000\t$899,400,000\t$15.30   Q1 23\t66,100,000\t$773,800,000\t$11.71   Q2 23\t65,500,000\t$780,700,000\t$11.92   Q3 23\t72,163,021\t$858,525,857\t$11.90   However, an alarming sign could be bookings per DAU stagnating YoY as this shows that the company is unable to monetize its DAU base. As a result, its revenues could stagnate even with DAUs increasing.   A reason behind this could be managements attempts to add more DAUs from higher age groups. However, that comes at the expense of younger DAUs which make up most of the gaming platforms DAUs.   Through this projected bookings per DAU metric, we can forecast Robloxs operating costs based on their percentage of bookings. But first, well forecast the companys cost of revenue and developer exchange fees.   Robloxs gross margin averaged 74.51% from Q1 2020 until Q4 2022.   Quarter\tRevenue\tCoR\tGross Margin   Q1 20\t$161,570,000\t$41,793,000\t74.13%   Q2 20\t$200,392,000\t$53,669,000\t73.22%   Q3 20\t$251,914,000\t$65,818,000\t73.87%   Q4 20\t$310,009,000\t$78,618,000\t74.64%   Q1 21\t$386,976,000\t$97,937,000\t74.69%   Q2 21\t$454,100,000\t$116,930,000\t74.25%   Q3 21\t$509,336,000\t$130,015,000\t74.47%   Q4 21\t$568,769,000\t$151,988,000\t73.28%   Q1 22\t$537,134,000\t$135,632,000\t74.75%   Q2 22\t$591,207,000\t$143,157,000\t75.79%   Q3 22\t$517,707,000\t$126,437,000\t75.58%   Q4 22\t$579,004,000\t$142,432,000\t75.40%   After that, its gross margin improved to an average of 76.51% in Q1 and Q2 2023 due to more bookings being processed through credit cards and prepaid cards which has a positive impact on its margins, per management in the Q1 earnings release. Therefore, we can forecast its gross margin in Q3 to be near that 76.51% figure. In this way, a projection for Robloxs Q3 cost of revenue could be $173.1 million.   Quarter\tRevenue\tCoR\tGross Margin   Q1 23\t$655,344,000\t$151,841,000\t76.83%   Q2 23\t$680,766,000\t$162,029,000\t76.20%   Q3 23\t$737,329,905\t$173,164,312\t76.51%   As for DEF, the company expected this expense to amount to $800 million in 2023 in the Q2 earnings call, and so far, it has incurred $348.2 million in the first half of the year, which means that it expects to incur $451.7 million for the rest of the year. With that in mind, Roblox has historically seen its DEF increase in Q3 and Q4, with the bulk of any given years total reported in Q4. Over the last 3 years, the company reported 31.15% of its total DEF in Q4. As such, we can project its DEF to be $202.5 million in Q3 and $249.2 million in Q4 based on managements forecast.

First, infrastructure and trust & safety expenses have ranged between 22%  28% of bookings since Q1 2022. In this way, we can calculate an average of 25.42% of bookings which results in an IST projection of $218.2 million, representing a 14.26% increase YoY. This is in line with managements expectations in the Q2 earnings call of bookings growth outpacing IST in Q3 since bookings, according to the model, would increase 22.35% YoY.   Quarter\tITS\t% of Bookings   Q1 22\t$141,355,000\t22.39%   Q2 22\t$158,235,000\t24.73%   Q3 22\t$190,986,000\t27.22%   Q4 22\t$198,505,000\t22.07%   Q1 23\t$211,044,000\t27.27%   Q2 23\t$225,039,000\t28.83%   Q3 23\t$218,223,202\t25.42%   Looking at Robloxs G&A and marketing costs, we can find that they represent 11.27% and 3.62% on average of bookings since Q1 2020. That said, the average for G&A doesnt take into account Q2, Q3, and Q4 2020 since the pandemic impacted them due to work from home policy which has led to lower costs. Based on these projected figures, we can forecast G&A cost to be $96.7 million in Q3, while marketing costs can be projected to be $31.1 million.

The company expects it to continue increasing this year due to increased headcount to develop new features and improve its overall product, according to its Q2 earnings report. That being said, Roblox plans to slow its headcount rate in 2024 through the end of 2025.   Based on this, we can estimate the R&D cost to amount to $367.7 million based on an average sequential growth rate of 16.62% since Q1 2020, representing 42.83% of the projected bookings.

As such, we can estimate interest income to be $32.9 million in Q3. As for interest expense, it has averaged around $10 million per quarter since Q1 2022, which we can use for the Q3 projection. This leaves other income which can be projected to be $484.5 thousand based on the average amount since Q1 2022.

Currently, the company is competing with Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTWO) and Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ: EA) in the gaming sector. With that in mind, Roblox has the highest forward P/S among its competitors, despite both companies being profitable and generating free cash flow.   Meanwhile, the sector median forward P/S is 1.08, indicating that Roblox is overvalued by 447.2%. However, a better figure benchmark ratio to use could be the average forward P/S of both EA and Take-Two which is 4.49. As such, we can reach a price target of $22.4, implying a 34% downside from current levels.   Upside Risks   Despite Robloxs bearish fundamentals, theres a risk to consider. While the platforms bookings per DAU have been declining YoY, theres a chance this trend is broken after its launch on PlayStation on October 10th. As is, its debut week on PlayStation was extremely successful as it ranked 3rd in the percentage of PlayStation players that played it at least once, according to Circanas video game industry analyst Mat Picatella. Moreover, the title reached more than 10 million downloads during its debut week, per Axios Stephen Totilo.   Technical Analysis   On the hourly chart, RBLX stock is in a neutral trend as it is trading in a sideways channel between $29.6 and $34. Looking at the indicators, the stock is above the 200 and 50 MAs which is a bullish sign. However, it recently failed to break resistance and broke through the 21 MA to the downside. Meanwhile, the RSI is neutral at 54 and the MACD is bearish.   As for the fundamentals, RBLXs upcoming Q3 earnings on November 8th will be a major catalyst for the stock. Given that the model forecasts the company to post a wider loss than expected along with declining bookings per DAU, its stock may fall and reach a level near the $22.41 price target. Since the stock failed to break resistance, investors could find the price range between $34 and $32 ideal for a short position.   RBLX Forecast   In summary, taking a short position in RBLX stock ahead of its Q3 earnings on November 8th may be a profitable decision as it is expected to post a wider loss than estimates, despite slightly beating analysts bookings estimate. Moreover, the model forecasts another decline in bookings per DAU in Q3 which is a sign that the company is struggling to monetize its growing DAUs. Meanwhile, the stock appears to be trading at a premium compared to its peers based on its forward P/S ratio. All of these factors could lead RBLX stock to fall in the near term and reach a level near the $22.41 price target.",

        "text": "Good morning everyone. Today's analysis focuses on the Real Estate equity sector, which has shown a bearish trend for an extended period. We will try to explain the causes of the negative performances and why the sector could represent a good investment opportunity for the end of the year.   Happy reading to all!   1. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS ISHARES US REAL ESTATE ETF   We start the article by analyzing the iShares US Real Estate ETF, an American ETF that replicates an index of US real estate stocks (with the ticker IYR). As you can see in the chart below, the ETF has shown a downward trend since February 2, 2023. In particular, from that peak, the price has formed a bearish technical figure known as a \"descending triangle\". From the peak of July 27, 2023, the price has suffered a sharp fall, culminating in the low reached on October 30, after breaking the triangle's support. Between July 27 and October 30, the ETF recorded a negative performance of -18.90%. However, on October 30, we observed a brief rebound, with an increase of +8.49%.   Technical Analysis IYR. Daily Chart   In the following figure, the ETF's exposure breakdown and the top 10 holdings are illustrated.   Holdings and exposure breakdowns. Source: iShares   2. WHAT ARE REITs?   The companies that are part of the ETF are known as \"REITs\", an acronym for \"Real Estate Investment Trust\". There are three types of REITs:   \tEquity REITs: These REITs buy and manage real estate properties   \tMortgage REITs: These REITs invest in mortgages and/or mortgage-backed securities   \tHybrid REITs: These REITs invest in both real estate properties and mortgages   Equity REITs generate their earnings mainly through lease rents, while Mortgage REITs profit from the interest derived from the mortgages they provide to real estate operators.   The companies that are part of the IYR ETF belong to the category of equity REITs. These can invest and manage different types of properties:   \tTelecommunication Tower REITs: They manage structures that support antennas for telecommunications. An example is American Tower (AMT)   \tIndustrial REITs: They manage industrial properties such as warehouses and logistics centers. An example is Prologis (PLD)   \tRetail REITs: They manage retail properties such as shopping centers and outlets. An example is Realty Income Corporation (O)   \tData Center REITs: They manage data centers that are generally rented to tech sector companies. An example is Equinix (EQIX)   \tSelf Storage REITs: They manage storage spaces. An example is Public Storage (PSA)   \tResidential REITs: They manage apartments and residential properties. An example is Camden Property Trust (CPT)   \tHealthcare REITs: They manage healthcare facilities, including hospitals. An example is Omega Healthcare (OHI)   \tOffice REITs: They manage office spaces. An example is Boston Properties (BXP)   \tReal Estate Services: These REITs provide various services, including real estate consulting   3. THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATES ON REITs   The following graph highlights an important aspect: the real estate sector ranks second to last in terms of performance since the beginning of the year. In particular, it has recorded a negative performance of -8.46%.   The performances of the 11 equity sectors of the S&P500 since the beginning of the year. Source: Finviz   The following graph reveals a significant fact: since January 2022, the real estate sector has continuously recorded a performance lower than its benchmark index, the S&P500.   The IYR ETF, since January 2022, has recorded a negative performance of -29.13%; better the S&P500, with a -6.6%. Daily Chart   The real estate sector has recorded disappointing performances due to the increase in interest rates. In general, the IYR ETF tends to suffer from an increase in expectations of a tightening of monetary policy, while it benefits in the opposite case. To illustrate this point, it is useful to create a bond sentiment index that reflects monetary policy expectations: LDQH/LQD. LQDH is an ETF that replicates the movement of US investment grade corporate bonds covered by the interest rate risk, while LQD represents the movement of the same bonds, but without coverage from that risk. The logic suggests that:  If there are expectations of a restrictive monetary policy, the bonds covered by the rates risk will perform better than those not covered. In the opposite case, the opposite will happen. This logic is confirmed by the following chart, which shows the correlation between LQDH/LQD and the Federal Reserves interest rates.   The positive correlation between LQDH/LQD and interest rates. Daily Chart   The following chart clearly illustrates how the REITs ETF, IYR, has performed negatively following the increase in expectations of restrictive monetary policy. In fact, every time LQDH/LQD has recorded an increase, the IYR ETF has shown a decrease.   The negative correlation between IYR and LQDH/LQD since 2022. Daily Chart   Moreover, the IYR ETF has continuously underperformed compared to its benchmark, the S&P500, every time monetary policy expectations have shown an upward trend.   LQDH/LQD and S&P500/IYR since 2022. Daily Chart   There are various factors that explain why REITs tend to suffer when interest rates rise. It is well known that a rise in interest rates tends to curb the investments and consumption of households and companies. This phenomenon has a negative impact on economic growth, as it causes a slowdown in industrial production and retail sales, both important data that impact GDP.   In a period of economic slowdown, companies reduce the demand for new properties for production and retail outlets due to contracting production and consumption. This translates into lower profits for industrial and retail REITs, which are among the most sensitive to changes in the economic cycle.   Even data center REITs, which are linked to tech companies, can feel the impact of rising interest rates. In fact, with higher rates, these companies may be less inclined to go into debt to expand, thus reducing the demand for data center spaces.   Office REITs could suffer from an increase in the unemployment rate related to the economic slowdown, and this could lead to a decrease in the demand for office spaces.   Residential REITs also suffer the negative impact of rising interest rates. In fact, in a context of higher rates, many tenants may find themselves in default, especially due to the increase in the unemployment rate, which leads to a reduction in household income.   In addition to the aspects already mentioned, there is another important element to consider: the REITs sector offers high dividends to shareholders, making the sector particularly attractive. However, an increase in interest rates also entails an increase in government bond yields. Consequently, many investors may choose to invest their capital in government bonds, which offer attractive coupons and are at the same time safer than stocks.   Another aspect to consider is that the dividend is a part of the company's profit. Therefore, if profits slow down, one can expect dividends to decrease as well; this provides a further incentive for investors to orient their investments towards government bonds.   Another aspect that can influence REITs when interest rates rise is related to their typical recourse to debt for the purchase of income-generating properties. If interest rates rise, the cost of debt (especially variable debt) becomes more burdensome, negatively affecting the balance sheets of companies. Moreover, with the increase in interest on debt, REITs may be less incentivized to expand, which means that an increase in interest rates can have a negative impact on the very growth of companies.   4. YEAR-END RALLY: WHY THE REAL ESTATE SECTOR COULD PROVE TO BE A GOOD CHOICE   If the much-anticipated year-end rally were to occur, the real estate sector could emerge as one of the best performers. The reason is simple: if the rally were to occur, it would probably be triggered by the statements of the Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, during the last meeting on November 1, which were positively received by the markets.   As can be seen in the following chart, the LQDH/LQD strength index recorded a bearish breakout of its bullish trendline after the last meeting. During the same period, IYR recorded a performance close to +10%.   The bearish breakout of the LQDH/LQD index trendline, accompanied by a rise in IYR. Daily Chart   If, in the coming weeks, LQDH/LQD were to continue to fall, IYR should benefit from it, thanks to expectations of a less restrictive monetary policy. A possible strategy, as illustrated in the following chart, could consider LQDH/LQD as a benchmark indicator and IYR as an asset on which to apply the strategy:   1. Wait for a retracement of LQDH/LQD on the bullish trendline, which could become a dynamic resistance, and then wait for a new bearish movement.   2. Enter the market on IYR, waiting for a bounce on the bearish trendline, which could become a dynamic support.   All of this, of course, assumes that the correlation coefficient remains in negative territory.   Operational hypothesis; this is not to be understood as financial advice. Daily Chart.   We conclude the analysis by emphasizing that the catalyst that pushed the real estate sector into bearish territory could now become the engine of a possible rise. But will it really be so? It is important to consider one more element: the meeting on November 1 was not the last one of the FED. The last meeting of the year will be held on December 13 and, as shown in the following chart, the forecasts indicate a maintenance of rates between 525 and 550 basis points (with a probability of 90.2%).   Target rate probabilities for 12 dec   This last meeting could determine the fate of the stock market for the end of 2023, influencing the famous Christmas rally.

        "text": "The world economy is facing economic slow down which has not yet affected US markets or the US economy. The recession warning indicator (top section on the chart) is hitting 100%.   The 2yr-10yr bonds rates are still inverted and the FED is determined to crush inflation before it adjusts rates. That's all uncertain but significant headwinds are present.   Looking at the main price chart showing the technology ETF (ticker: XLK), it has just made a new 3 month high. It would be great to see XLK now consolidate between $170 and $177 and then retest the 20 week moving average and bounce up closing a week above $170 before it then gets up above $177. This way we'd have a clear higher low which would give early confirmation that we've broken the downtrend that started after the July 2023 high.   From there, I'll be looking to see if it can reach all time highs.   Despite that bullish view, I think the US markets may merely be in a short term uptrend.   These uptrends can be supercharged whenever there are a lot of short sellers who are getting wrecked by these fast moves to the upside.   But I am just as willing to believe there will be similarly harsh drops to the downside if people are leveraging up in their \"Buy the dip\" frenzy and if the general market sentiment swings too rapidly away from \"Fear\" into \"Greed\".   By it's nature, the market is a fluctuating mechanical beast that is attracted to liquidity (pools of money that are on the wrong side of the current market direction). Whenever liquidity gets released rapidly then we get dramatic shifts in price. These liquidity releases occur when investors and traders (either short or long) capitulate or get wrecked. The mechanical beast will always hunt stop losses and move against the majority of traders. In this way the market works best when it wrecks both the shorts and the longs until they give up and new money comes in that isn't sensitive to capitulating. But right now we're in a market where every long-only investor should have at least one eye on the recession warnings and short only investors should not believe their own bs regarding the timing they hope to see the market capitulate.   Based on this theory of the market, it seems very possible for XLK and perhaps some other sectors to reach all time highs just ahead of a major downtrend. But it will not come when everyone is ready and positioned for it.   The macro economic picture is mixed.   The FED hasn't raised interest rates and is waiting for the economy to either start to weaken or force the FED to raise short term rates further. US unemployment is just starting to tick up after being below historical trend. US private debt remains low. US government debt (treasury bills and bonds) are continuing to be bought so, in theory, the US might squeak through this period. I doubt it though as history is against that happening.   So for now, I continue to hold my longs from the October lows. I will look to take 50% profit on XLK near to $180 and otherwise be guided on how the market reacts as it reaches resistance points and forms new higher highs or lower lows.   I'll definitely be thinking about the risk free rate of earning over 4% in cash in almost any place I look. If we don't confirm an uptrend that's going to be very appealing.   Risk management:   If prices spike back down and make new lows below the October lows then I will sell my positions on any retraces and just wait to see what happens and look for when a new uptrend starts to emerge after the sideways chop and because I hope to avoid any significant downtrend.",

I would strictly say that the -1 sig has been engaged 6 days already, but the fact that it pushed up to the VWAP and sold off tells me that the buying algo is still in play.   Sold Puts at the 80 strike below -2 sig on the bullish model.   Overall, I do think XLE goes higher into the Bearish +1 sig near 89 and gives time for the 80 puts 46 DTE to die.   Decent entry at .30 but the high trade of the day was .34.   This was just above the 15 min chart -1 sig low which held the session beautifully.

If XLE pushes in the next few days down past 84 I will roll further out, and maybe 1 or 2 down.   If XLE eats time and rallies up to 89 I will do nothing.   If XLE gets a break above 89 and attacks 89.25 I will consider selling Calls at the 94 strike.

I took a dive into SAVE stocks which, amidst the earnings aftermath, boasted an IV Rank over 94 due to the hefty market plunge. In the tempest of the airlines' current headwinds, staying cool was the game, and I laid out a strangle to exploit that sweet 85% probability of profit at a 1:2 required buying power ratioa number I find particularly enticing. The break-evens are sitting pretty, giving us room to breathe, and I'm gunning for a $120 max profit while my obligations are just $260 for the remaining 39 days, thanks to that spicy high IVR. Management options down the line are looking lush, especially when it comes to rolling.   On the ledger, I dispatched a $15 strike SAVE call for $0.80 and a $7.50 strike SAVE put for $0.53, bagging a cool $133 in credit upfront, minor commissions and fees notwithstanding.   To wrap up today's strategy: I positioned a well-balanced strangle on SAVE stock, taking into account the industry's rough patch. My opening balance clocked in at $133 in credit, which promises a rich tapestry of rolling opportunities in the days ahead. On this fine day of November 6, 2023, I have executed the sale of one call and one put option, summing up to $133 in credit, minus the petty cash for costs. Looking forward, I foresee this position offering ample management plays.",

It's always really interesting to watch these dates line up with direction changes. I'd say they work more than they don't +/- a day.   All the energy in the SPY has shifted negative, and as I asked for a percentage move down, I was pleasantly surprised to find it calculated out to my old target at $407! The more often the same number (or close to it) pops up, usually the better. It doesn't always work though, unfortunately, but it does give me my fairly reliable \"reaches target\" answer when I ask about $407.   Going back I did have a lower target on /ES that breaks that 4100 level and lands in the zone of 4075-90.   My only issue is I have another date this Friday-Monday, so it seems a stretch to go right back down just as fast as we went up, but who knows.   I ask what to tell you fine people in the big picture and get \"bear market begins\". Number of days? 7. There's that Monday date again, so watch it and good luck.",

        "text": "Hey everyone, Greg is here with a quick rundown of todays options trading play. I entered the ring with a naked call on   GLD   , aiming for that sweet spot of easy returns on a maximal Pop trade. Todays golden ticket could net me a max profit of $118 with a probability of profit (PoP) sitting pretty at 80%, all while tying up $3000 of buying power and riding on an implied volatility rank (IVR) of 20%.   The game plan was simple: watch the market, play it cool, and have a couple of scenarios up my sleeve:   (Scenario A) If the price hikes, I'll pivot to a strangle, balancing out with a sold put to accompany my call.   (Scenario B) If it looks like easy money, Ill lock in those gains and close out the current trade, quick and clean.   The strategy is all about simplicity, with an exit plan to bow out gracefully at about 65% of the max profit. As of today, November 5, 2023, that naked call is open and Im in the market.   To wrap it up, heres the play-by-play for today:   Date: November 5 , 2023   Strategy: Naked Call on   GLD   Opening Credit: $118   Expected Profit: Exiting at ~65% of max profit   Probability of Profit (PoP): 80%   Required Buying Power (Req.BP): $3000   Implied Volatility Rank (IVR): 20   Current Position Balance (as of opening): $118 of credit (1.18cr)   Stay tuned to see which scenario unfolds and how the trades balance shifts in the coming days.

It seems like when these pop in super fast they're super good, though TXN is a bit slow atm.   The number that floated in was 14, so when I saw they closed Friday at $112.xx I decided this was for realz. Obviously it's at $114 today. I had my intuitive symbol for down float into mind, and sensed we're to expect down.   I didn't spend more time on it other than to dowse just now. The target I get is $95 and that it will be reached. I don't give a target any longer unless I get this verification as it's becoming pretty reliable. The \"big idea\" is a breakdown, so that validates my intuition. Whether I'm correct will be another matter!   Like other tickers/indexes I've inquired on today, there's an indication of going up into Thursday. NFP Friday could shake things up, but at this point, I'd be good shorting this late this week.   I'll update if there's anything sketchy when I check on it on Thursday. Not looking at much upside. Maybe to $118-19",

In the macroeconomic backdrop, it has outperformed over the last year with a 13.51% return, while the S&P 500 Index declined by 13.31%. This market performance grants Apple a \"B\" rating in our evaluation, scoring 68.86%.   Turning our attention to the company's financials, Apple's revenue per share is $24.458, and its net income per share stands at $6.0365. Operating and free cash flows are at $7.2031 and $6.4332, respectively. The company's P/E ratio is currently at 28.8192, suggesting a bullish market sentiment. Apple's latest 10-K reveals growth in net sales, operating income, and net profit, but there's a decrease in cash and equivalents, and an uptick in inventories and payables. The company's success, as emphasized, is anchored on product innovation, supply chain management, and market strategies. However, a Q3'23 decline in net income and lukewarm new product sales are concerning.   Technically, on a daily chart, AAPL is initiating its 4th wave, targeting $198.88 for its 5th wave. A robust support exists near $165. The MACD indicates a potential bullish crossover, and the RSI showcases a double-bottom support. Given the current financial standing, our advice is to continue holding. Short-term focus should be on the R1 resistance at $179. A breakthrough here might signal a hold or slight addition to positions. If there's strong resistance at R1, keep an eye on the S1 support level. If the price breaches the S1, please reach out.",

The rising wedge pattern typically occurs after an uptrend and signals a potential reversal in the security's price. It is a bearish chart formation commonly observed in technical analysis within the context of trading and investment. It is characterized by converging trendlines, where both the support and resistance trendlines are sloping upward.   Strong trends are the result of an imbalance between buyers and sellers. At each price, buyers and sellers are transacting. If theres an imbalance with a lot of buyers and no sellers, then the price must readjust quickly to higher levels, which will hopefully attract more sellers into the marketplace.  This can lead to a sell off due to oversupply of buyers.   If the higher pricing fails to draw in more sellers, then the price will continue to quickly readjust higher. This swift readjustment creates strong uptrends that begin to attract more buyers, who fear missing out on a powerful trend (known as FOMO, or fear of missing out).   Overbought with RSI on 70.

        "text": "Jim Simons said:   \"We have three criteria: If it's publicly traded, liquid and amenable to modeling, we trade it.\"   This quote is from an interview with Simons in 2000. The three criteria he mentioned are the basic requirements for any asset that Renaissance Technologies would consider trading.   Publicly traded means that the asset can be bought and sold on a public exchange. This allows Renaissance Technologies to gather data on the asset's price movements.   Liquid means that there is a large enough market for the asset so that it can be bought and sold easily without affecting the price too much. This is important for Renaissance Technologies to be able to trade the asset effectively.   Amenable to modeling means that the asset's price movements can be explained by a mathematical model. This allows Renaissance Technologies to predict the asset's future price movements and make informed trading decisions.   Simons' quote is a good summary of the quantitative investment approach that Renaissance Technologies uses. This approach is based on the idea that financial markets are not completely random, but rather contain patterns that can be identified and exploited by using mathematical models.   Renaissance Technologies has been very successful using this approach. Its flagship Medallion fund has generated annualized returns of over 35% since its inception in 1988. This makes it one of the most successful hedge funds in history.   The quote from Jim Simons is a reminder that quantitative investing is a complex and challenging field. However, it can be very rewarding for those who are successful.",

        "text": "Primary Chart: IWM / Russell 2000 Weekly Timeframe   The Russell 2000 (IWM) is often a leading indicator in US markets. It led to the downside in early November 2021 after a false breakout out of its 2021 topping-pattern's resistance around $234. SPX topped nearly two months later on January 4, 2022. While small-caps are not necessarily always the first to make a move, it is something frequently cited by commentators and analysts. This is why the Russell 2000 is important for traders and investors to follow to maintain a deeper understanding of the broader US equity markets.   Despite a very strong weekly close for IWM, its price remains in the lower half of its trading range. This trading range has contained price for the past 1.5 years, since the topping pattern's support (at the upper blue rectangle) broke down in January 2022. Unlike other major US indices like the Nasdaq 100, IWM has continued to struggle and remains well below its August 2022 and January / February 2023 highs.   Two months ago, in a recent post titled \"   Something is Rotten in the State of Markets   ,\" IWM's underperformance of SPX provided a basis for discussion as to why US equity markets may remain unhealthy despite the bullish price action YTD (see link below). A strong and long-lasting bull market should show signs of broad participation. Many breadth indicators have shown very narrow breadth. It's not a surprise, in fact, that SPX's rally and upside performance has been driven by 5 to 10 SPX names, with the other 490-495 flat, lagging, or up weakly.   Supplementary Chart A   This previous April 10 analysis displayed a hypothetical price path intended to reflect the possibility of more sideways and choppy price action in the intermediate term. The choppy price action has largely unfolded as expected (click the play / refresh arrow on the prior post from April 10, 2023). In fact, IWM's price at the time of the prior post was at $173.89, and a month later on May 8 it had closed almost at the same level around $172.72.   Now IWM appears to be breaking above the recent trading range. Major levels of resistance appear on the Primary Chart as Fibonacci levels (the .618 retracement and the .50 retracement, which is not technically a Fibonacci proportion) as well as the anchored VWAP from the November 2021 ATH.  How price responds to these levels will be important to watch in coming weeks especially after June 16, 2023 OPEXa quad witching event.   It is notable that IWM trades far below its major ATH VWAP from November 2021.  Compare how IWM's price trades relative to this VWAP (labeled on the Primary Chart above) with how SPY's price trades relative to its ATH VWAP. SPY's VWAP anchored to its ATH is shown in Supplementary chart B below.   Supplementary Chart B   Finally, a relative chart of Russell 2000 vs. S&P 500 is helpful to examine these two major US equity indices and how IWM has performed YTD relative to the SPY / SPX.  See Supplementary Chart C below.  This relative chart shows IWM still in a downtrend relative to SPY. And it still shows that IWM vs. SPY remains below major resistance. Given that IWM is a leading index at times, it will be interesting to see whether what happens to the major resistance on this relative chart that was broken in early April 2023. Will it hold?   Supplementary Chart C   In summary, the small-cap stocks in the US equity market are lagging despite putting in a strong weekly performance this week of +3.33%. The primary trend in small caps remains sideways by any measure. Will IWM play catch up to the other main US indices like S&P 500 (   SPX   ) and Nasdaq 100 (   NDX   QQQ   )?  No one knows for sure. But the liquidity problems plaguing the US economy tend to show up in the weakest names first, which usually are also the smallest names. Could IWM's underperformance be a sign of this liquidity stress?  Or will it catch up to confirm that the current rally in NDX and SPY are perfectly healthy under the hood and headed to new all-time highs?  Stay tuned.

Finally posted a tiny bit more positive earnings compared to expectation.   Meanwhile a falling wedge formation created. Also moving in a big downward channel. There are two scenarios for counting the waves, one scenario suggests, that the wave 5 down could be finished (1.618 extension was put in a few days ago), and we are up for at least an A-B-C upside correction.   Possibly (but not guaranteed) we just starting to put in the Wave \"A\", so far.   Consodilation in a smaller channel happening, with one breakout to the top,which could fall back. Important thing in order to have this idea a basis, is not to put in a new low (0.7252), and not to stay below comfortably 0.78. If that happens, then I need to assume new lows are coming.   It is possible, that this 0.78 level will be retested, I am following SUNW's actions now more closely.   On the daily, RSI is started to come up a bit, trying to leave the oversold levels. MACD coming up, a little bit week still.   The 9/15 SMA's starting to turn updwards, currently being a possible support. 21day EMA so far rejecting price actions, so we are squeezed in between those.   52day EMA/180 EMA, 200SMA coming down, 52 in a higher speed.   On the weekly, 200 SMA up at around 3.92; it is far away (to be a resistance)   Weekly RSI is on oversold levels (could drop more of course), trying to leave it, now showing sign of possible normalization,   MACD indicator could start to converge (in a few weeks could be divergenced, but no guarantee)   I have opened a long position( accumulation purposes), regardless of this idea.   I plan to open an other one for swing-trading, IF we restest the 0.78 fib level and popping back up from that (meaning possible wave 3 starting to the upside, and wave 2 is in)   Also be aware, as of now, the 1st quarter 2023 results,conference call and webcast was postponed, which might heavily influence the price actions (and sure it has a reason behind it.)

The main pattern on todays chart is the pair of converging trendlines. Falling resistance began last November and rising support started in June. Prices are stuck in the narrowing range, with the potential catalyst of earnings tomorrow afternoon. This big event could potentially inject volatility back into the chart.   Next you have the 50- and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs). While the 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA, they give little clear sense of direction or trend. That could mean OXY is neutral over the intermediate and longer terms. If it   was   bullish and is   now   neutral, could the pendulum keep swinging toward bearish?   Third, TradeStation data shows energy is the worst-performing sector so far in the fourth quarter after leading in Q3. The most recent economic data has also been non-inflationary -- at the same time that   U.S. domestic oil production shoots   to record highs.   Finally, consider the chart below of   SEDG   SolarEdge Technologies. It had a similar triangle pattern and sideways movement before plunging on weak results in August.   SEDGs decline accelerated after breaking its 52-week low. This could keep attention on OXYs 52-week low from March. If the oil driller behaves similarly to peers like   XOM   Exxon Mobil and   CVX   Chevron after its results, a breakdown could be in the cards.

It was just an idea....now we are almost 100% up.   Surpassed 90% return on this trade since taking up positions in June 2022 and again in Jan 2023.   I sold a portion in Aug 2023 with a breach of the 21 day SMA and reentered slightly lower with a stop.   We then reclaimed the 21 day and started moving towards the target.   What's beautiful about this trade is the following:   1. We had a double bottom   2. We then had a parallel channel breakout with a target that aligned with the 1.618 fib extension.   3. As things progressed we identified a 5 wave Elliot count.   Now we have clear incoming targets at $9.04 and $10.17. We will use the RSI oversold timeframes from the past to help identify when we need to watch the chart carefully (red area) and we also know we can rely on the 21 day SMA as a trigger sell.   All the hard work is done here on this trade. We just need to ensure we sell some of our position or all of it if it breaks down. Typically after a 5 wave count you get an ABC style correction. With the TA being perfect on this chart to date, it would not surprise me to see a good correction when this wave 5 completes. All the same, we remain in a winning trade and stay on trend until the trend changes.   I almost forgot to mention earnings are released next Tuesday 14th November , so we will need to keep an eye then too.   NU   PUKA",

        "text": "Last year I produced several posts that described a methodology utilizing long term momentum changes between asset classes and the relationship among asset classes to help anticipate the business cycle. That series is linked below.   When I worked in the institutional setting I would place hundreds of assets, ratios, spreads of individual corporate bonds and equities into a 4 quadrant MACD momentum matrix. I would then condense the raw data into thematic groups and see what the matrix implied about the business cycle. As an individual investor with limited time and fewer resources, I generally plot 80 assets and spreads and find that sufficient to extract a view.   For most of the last two decades the liquidity regime provided by monetary and fiscal policy disrupted the economies natural cycle. But, I believe that policy inflections have occurred and that asset prices will again become more connected to the real economy and less connected to policy. Analysis such as this will again become more useful.   Methodology: Individual markets and ratios are plotted in the quadrant   that best describes their combination of momentum and price action. The precise point where the individual plots fall in the matrix is not nearly as important as the overall pattern of multiple plot points and the general weight of the evidence.   It is important to realize that the momentum state is not always obvious. Accept that its messy and use your best judgement in deciding on quadrants. The idea is to build a general view of the market and economic cycle.   What defines the momentum quadrant? The monthly perspective moving average convergence divergence oscillator (MACD). The individual quadrants reflect the relationship between the 13 and 26 month exponentially smoothed averages.   Quadrant One: Waning Bear: In this quadrant momentum is bearish with the shorter average below the longer average, but the difference between the two is becoming less. Momentum is still lower, but at a decreasing rate.   Quadrant Two: Strong Advance: In this quadrant momentum is bullish with the shorter average above the longer average and the difference between the two is becoming greater. Momentum is higher at an increasing rate.   Quadrant Three: Waning Bull: In this quadrant momentum is bullish with the shorter average above the longer average, but the difference between the two is becoming less. Momentum is still higher, but at a decreasing rate.   Quadrant Four: Strong Decline: In this quadrant momentum is bearish with the shorter average below the longer average and the difference between the two is becoming greater. Momentum is lower at an increasing rate.   Trading Range: A market in a trading range is removed from the matrix until it breaks from the range even if MACD momentum has been falling/rising for months.   Over the next few posts, we will briefly address the construction of the matrix, and attempt to draw conclusions around the market and economic cycles.

(this is my personal analysis taking the worst financials case of LUMN for the next 4 quarters).   The weekly and monthly charts show continues sell off with possible accumulation phase just started, in the coming months this can be confirmed if we see price stabilization around $1 and volume remains high.   As per Fintel data, the institutional ownership percentage is dropping for the (at least) second quarter in a row.   This is an opportunity to target 2026/2027 at least, less then 5% of the capital to be allocated.   return may exceed 1000% (not guaranteed in shorter term), loss of 100% is highly possible if the new CEO fails to save the company + worst debt with higher yields.

The deal, valued at $89.45 per share, involved an exchange of 0.84 ExxonMobil shares for each Denbury share.   The acquisition integrates ExxonMobil's expertise with Denburys extensive CO2 pipeline network and workforce, thereby enhancing their low-carbon leadership and capacity to address industrial decarbonization, as well as reducing their own emissions. ExxonMobil now controls the largest CO2 pipeline network in the U.S., spanning over 1,300 miles, including 925 miles across Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi - the largest U.S. markets for CO2 emissions.   In addition to the pipeline network, the deal incorporated over 15 onshore CO2 storage sites into ExxonMobil's portfolio. These assets are expected to play a significant role in the company's efforts towards reducing CO2 emissions by over 100 million metric tons annually.   The acquisition also includes Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain oil and gas operations, which provide immediate operating cash flow and offer additional options for carbon capture operations. As of 2022, these operations held over 200 million barrels of proven oil equivalent reserves and were producing approximately 46,000 oil-equivalent barrels daily.

        "text": "Motorola Solutions, Inc. MSI reported strong third-quarter 2023 results, driven by the diligent execution of operational plans and healthy growth dynamics backed by solid order trends. Both adjusted earnings and revenues surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. In addition, Motorola achieved record third-quarter revenues, earnings, cash flow and backlog, which further exemplified the strength of its portfolio. The company expects this growth momentum to continue in the near term on robust demand patterns.   Net Earnings   On a GAAP basis, net earnings in the third quarter were $464 million or $2.70 per share compared with $279 million or $1.63 per share in the year-earlier quarter. The year-over-year improvement was primarily attributable to top-line growth and lower cost of sales.   Excluding non-recurring items, non-GAAP earnings in the quarter were $547 million or $3.19 per share compared with $514 million or $3.00 per share in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17 cents.   Revenues   Quarterly net sales were record high at $2,556 million, up 7.7% year over year, with solid sales in both segments across all regions driven by the strength of its business model and the value of its mission-critical integrated ecosystem. The company witnessed strong demand for video security, command center software and LMR (land mobile radio) services. The top line beat the consensus estimate of $2,516 million.   Region-wise, quarterly revenues were up 5.7% in North America to $1,783 million due to growth in LMR, command center software and video security products. International revenues were up 12.7% to $773 million, with growth in video security products, LMR and command center software. Acquisitions contributed $19 million to revenues, while foreign exchange tailwinds were $13 million.   Segmental Performance   Net sales from Products and Systems Integration increased to $1,612 million from $1,529 million in the year-ago quarter, driven by higher demand for LMR and video security solutions. It also exceeded our revenue estimates of $1,552 million. The segments backlog was up $62 million to $4.9 billion, primarily due to high LMR demand in North America.   Net sales from Software and Services were up 11.8% to $944 million, with solid performance across command center software, LMR and video security services. However, the segment revenues missed our estimates of $962.8 million. The segments backlog increased $702 million to $9.4 billion, primarily due to higher multi-year software and services contracts in North America and favorable currency impact, partially offset by revenue recognition for the Airwave contract.   Other Quarterly Details   GAAP operating earnings increased to $639 million from $373 million in the prior-year quarter, while non-GAAP operating earnings were up to $741 million from $676 million. The company ended the quarter with a record backlog of $14.3 billion, up $764 million year over year.   Overall GAAP operating margin was 25%, up from 15.7%, while non-GAAP operating margin was 29% compared with 28.5% in the year-ago quarter. The increase in GAAP operating margin was primarily due to higher sales.   Cash Flow and Liquidity   Motorola generated $714 million cash from operating activities in the reported quarter compared with an operating cash flow of $388 million a year ago. Free cash flow in the third quarter was $649 million. The company repurchased $322 million worth of stock during the third quarter. As of Sep 30, 2023, MSI had $910 million of cash and cash equivalents with $4,704 million of long-term debt.   Guidance Up   With solid quarterly results and robust demand patterns, the company raised its earlier guidance for 2023. Non-GAAP earnings for 2023 are currently expected in the $11.65-$11.70 per share range, up from $11.40-$11.48 on revenues of $9.930 billion to $9.945 billion, up from $9.875 billion to $9.900 billion estimated earlier, with a rise in both segments on higher demand.   For fourth-quarter 2023, non-GAAP earnings are expected in the $3.60-$3.65 per share range on year-over-year revenue improvement of approximately 4% due to healthy demand trends.   Moving Forward   Motorola is poised to gain from disciplined capital deployment and a strong balance sheet position. The company expects strong demand across LMR products, the video security portfolio, services and software while benefiting from a solid foundation.   Price Momentum   MSI is trading near the top of its 52-week range and above its 200-day simple moving average. Investors have been pushing the share price higher, and the stock still appears to have upward momentum. This is a positive sign for the stock's future value.",

        "text": "CleanSpark, Inc. (Nasdaq: CLSK) is one of the fastest-growing public Bitcoin miners in North America that gained wide interest from investors thanks to its operational efficiency. Over the last 5 months, the company increased its hash rate by nearly 50%, positioning itself to reach its planned capacity of 16 EH/s by the end of the year. With 2 major Bitcoin catalysts approaching in the first half of 2024, the companys expansion comes at a perfect timing to capitalize on those catalysts which are the anticipated SEC approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF and the Bitcoin halving. Given that the company appears to be trading at a discount compared to other major Bitcoin miners based on its P/S ratio and P/B ratio, CLSK stock could be one of the best Bitcoin miners to invest in ahead of the upcoming Bitcoin tailwinds.   CLSK Fundamentals   Bitcoin Catalysts   By January 10, 2024, the SEC is set to make a decision regarding Ark Invests spot Bitcoin ETF application which would be a major catalyst for the cryptocurrency. A spot Bitcoin ETF would function similarly to other ETFs in that it would be regulated by the SEC and subject to strict reporting requirements. This would provide investors with a level of transparency and oversight that is often lacking in the cryptocurrency market. Not only that but a spot Bitcoin ETF would bring institutional-grade custody solutions, reducing the risk of theft or loss of Bitcoin.   As such, the SEC approving a spot Bitcoin ETF could have positive implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. The most significant result of the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF is that it could open substantial pools of capital to the Bitcoin market. In addition, it could signal a greater acceptance and recognition of Bitcoin by regulatory authorities, potentially leading to increased adoption and mainstream integration of Bitcoin. Given this expected surge in demand for the cryptocurrency, Bitcoins price may increase substantially in case the SEC approves Ark Invests application.   With that in mind, the SEC has so far resisted approving spot Bitcoin ETFs, citing risks such as fraud and market manipulation. However, this stance may change given the commissions decision not to appeal an August court ruling that may pave the way for the $18.4 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC: GBTC) to convert to an ETF.   This has led Bloomberg Intelligence analysts to say that approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF looks inevitable and that several funds are likely to be given the green light, although the exact timing remains uncertain. In fact, several analysts believe that there is a 75% chance the SEC will approve the first spot Bitcoin ETF by the end of 2023, in light of Grayscales victory against the commission.   As the likelihood of a spot Bitcoin ETF being approved appears to be higher than ever, this would coincide with the biggest catalyst for Bitcoin. The Bitcoin halving. Bitcoin halving is a key event in the world of crypto and is expected to occur in April 2024. The significance of this event is that Bitcoin prices have historically surged in the year prior to and post each of the previous 3 halvings.   First Halving   The first Bitcoin halving occurred in November 2012, and in the year prior to the event, Bitcoin surged by as much as 595.7%, reaching a then-all-time high of $16. That said, the bigger movement occurred in the year following the event as Bitcoin climbed a staggering 9413.16%, also reaching a then-all-time high of $1165.   Second Halving   This trend continued prior to the second halving that occurred in July 2016 as Bitcoin prices increased by as much as 248.86% in the year prior to the event. Following the event, Bitcoin went on to record a massive 2948.38% run where it reached a then-all-time high of nearly $20 thousand in December 2017.   Third Halving   The third halving occurred in May 2020 and Bitcoin prices followed the same trend as Bitcoin surged by as much as 314% in the year prior to the halving, before reaching its all-time high of $69 thousand in the year following the event in November 2021.   The price performance has been rather identical before and after the last three halvings based on the charts. Therefore, we can use this historical data to predict the same trend to occur in the upcoming halving event. As is, Bitcoin is up more than 110% on a YTD basis which is in line with the usual run in the year prior to the halving.   In this way, there is a strong possibility Bitcoin will reach a new all-time high in 2025 based on the historical trend which shows that the cryptocurrency reaches a new all-time high in the year after the halving.   Profitability Post Halving?   Considering the potential increase in Bitcoin prices over the next 2 years, CLSKs expansion could not have come at a better time. While Bitcoin mining profitability declined by 44% over the last year, the company continued to increase production which could have extremely positive implications for the companys Bitcoin stash in the future.   Not only did CLSK continue increasing production but it is also actively working to increase its hashrate which allows it to mine more Bitcoin. On June 1st, the company purchased 12,500 new Antminer S19 XP units for $40.5 million, effectively increasing its hash rate of 6.7 EH/s by 1.76 EH/s. This purchase positions the miner to meet and potentially exceed its year-end target of 16 EH/s, per CEO Zach Bradford.   CLSK also purchased 4.4 EH/s of Antminer S21 bitcoin mining machines, which are scheduled to be delivered in early 2024, which will increase its hash rate to more than 20 EH/s once plugged in. To put this into perspective, industry leader Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: MARA) has an installed hash rate of 23.1 EH/s, while another industry leader Riot Platforms, Inc. (Nasdaq: RIOT) expects to reach a hash rate of 20.01 EH/s in mid-2024.   In tandem with increasing its hash rate, CLSK is also effectively working to keep its energy and maintenance costs low, mainly due to its location in Georgia where electricity prices are low. This is critical for Bitcoin miners as keeping their business profitable is very much about increasing hash rate and keeping facility costs like energy and maintenance down. Therefore, CLSKs location and ongoing expansion may help it become profitable if Bitcoin prices increase as expected due to the aforementioned catalysts.   With that in mind, CLSKs cost per mined Bitcoin of $14.3 thousand is among the best in the industry. For context, MARAs  the industry leader in terms of production  cost per mined Bitcoin is high at nearly $19 thousand. Meanwhile, RIOTs  the industry leader in terms of cost management  cost per mined Bitcoin is $13.4 thousand. With production expected to be near the levels of MARA in early 2024 while managing its costs in a similar fashion to RIOT, CLSK combines the advantages of both industry leaders which could make it a viable investment in the Bitcoin mining sector.   Valuation   In terms of its valuation, CLSK stock appears to be undervalued compared to MARA and RIOT. Looking into each companys forward P/S ratio, CLSK is trading at 4x its 2023 sales, while MARA and RIOT are trading at 5.43x and & 7.32x, respectively. If we look at each companys 2024 forward P/S, CLSK appears to be more undervalued as it is trading at 1.82x its 2024 sales, while MARA and RIOT are trading at 4.07x and 4.65x, respectively.   Given the growth potential of the Bitcoin mining industry due to the anticipated impact of the upcoming halving on Bitcoin prices, these sales multiples may not indicate that MARA and RIOT are overvalued. Instead, it could be viewed that the market is discounting CLSKs growth potential despite its ongoing expansion that will bring its production closer to MARA while managing its costs at comparable levels to RIOT.   Not only does CLSK appear to be undervalued based on its forward P/S ratio but it could also be considered undervalued based on its P/B ratio. Looking at the table below, we can find that CLSKs P/B ratio is 1.13, less than MARAs 2.69 and RIOTs 1.7. Given that the average P/B ratio of both industry leaders is 2.19, we can reach a price target of $8.68 for CLSK stock, implying a 95% upside from current levels.

First, the main catalyst for all Bitcoin miners is the expected increase in Bitcoin prices following the halving. That said, it is not guaranteed that Bitcoin will increase in a similar fashion to the previous 3 halvings as the current macro environment is vastly different from the last 3 halving events.   Another risk to consider is that the SECs decision not to appeal the court ruling in Grayscales lawsuit may be seen as a change in the commissions stance toward cryptocurrencies, it is still not guaranteed that a spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved. As such, the expected surge in demand for Bitcoin may not materialize which will keep the cryptocurrencys prices suppressed.   CLSK also has a long history of diluting its shareholders which is a critical risk to consider before investing in the stock. As is, the companys OS nearly tripled from 41.4 million in Q1 2022 to more than 152.6 million in Q3 2023.   Technical Analysis   CLSK stock is in a bearish trend with the stock in a downward channel since reaching its 52-week high in July. Looking at the indicators, the stock is above the 200, 50, and 21 MAs which is a bullish sign. While the RSI is neutral at 53, the MACD is approaching a bearish crossover, which could see the stock retest one of its MA supports unless a strong upward movement in Bitcoins price occurs.   As for the fundamentals, CLSK may be one of the best Bitcoin mining stocks to own for investors bullish on the sector thanks to its ongoing expansion that will bring its hash rate near MARAs while maintaining efficient cost management similar to that of RIOT. Given that the stock is likely undervalued when looking at its forward P/S and P/B ratios, investors could find retests of key supports ideal entries for a long position.   CLSK Fundamentals   In conclusion, CLSK stock appears to be well-positioned to benefit greatly from the upcoming Bitcoin catalysts which are the SECs possible approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF and Aprils Bitcoin halving. Given these catalysts potential positive impact on Bitcoin prices, the companys ongoing expansion may bear fruit if the cryptocurrencys price increases as anticipated since it would be able to mine more Bitcoin. When combined with its solid cost management, the company has a clear path toward profitability if Bitcoin prices follow the trend of reaching a new all-time high in the year following the halving. With the stock trading at a discount compared to its peers MARA and RIOT based on its forward P/S and P/B ratios, CLSK stock may be an opportunity to gain exposure to Bitcoin prices as its performance could allow it to reach the $8.68 price target.",

        "text": "---Elliott wave analysis---   As you can see on the daily chart, There is an impulsive cycle from the low of 5960 that validates all the required rules of the Elliott wave principle given below:   Wave (2) can never exceed the starting point of wave (1).   Wave (3) can never be the shortest wave among (1), (3) & (5).   Wave (4) can never enter the price territory of wave (1).   So, we have a valid reason to validate the wave count. In addition, FSLR's wave cycle has the following formation in the wave with Fibonacci levels:   Wave (1) is an impulse wave.   Wave (2) retraced 100% of wave (1). It has formed A-B-C zigzag.   Wave (3) is an extended wave.   Wabe (4) is a complex correction W-X-Y, that retraced to 0.382 level.   Wave (5) is an ending diagonal.   Wave A retraced 0.382 of wave (5), which extended to 1.618 level.   Wave (B) retraced 100% of wave A.   FLSR had accomplished impulsive structure at   232   and started corrective formation. It looks like the correction phase occurred at   132.19   . We can expect a new motive cycle from   132.19   . Traders should carefully watch the breakout of wave 4 of wave (c).   Target projection:   Using Reverse Fibonacci of wave (B)   Reverse Fibonacci Of correction   resistance and pivot levels   From the above projections, we can find a cluster of levels to measure our targets. Traders can follow cluster targets: 168 - 188 - 192 or higher. It can extend up to 100% at 232.   Alternatively, Failure can continue correction to the final support level of 115.58, which is less likely to happen.   ---Indicator Study:---   Average true range:   ATR of the FLSR rose to 7.79 when the price was rising. It suggests that we can get a rapid upward move after the breakout of wave (4).   RSI:   The RSI of the FLSR surged from   31.09 to 49.5   . RSI surge along with price suggests that bulls have a strong grip on the stock. We can also see a divergence from the previous move.   Exponential Moving averages:   Major EMAs, such as the   200-day and 100-day   , are trading above the price, but the   20-day   Exponential Moving Average is being broken by FSLR.

        "text": "Shares of Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) have gained 5.8% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $162.01, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $206.55 indicates a potential upside of 27.5%.   The average comprises 11 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $160 to a high of $250, with a standard deviation of $26.55. While the lowest estimate indicates a decline of 1.2% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 54.3% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.   While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.   But, for CELH, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.   However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.   Price Momentum   CELH is trading near the top of its 52-week range and above its 200-day simple moving average.   Investors have been pushing the share price higher, and the stock still appears to have upward momentum. This is a positive sign for the stock's future value.",

This growth stands in stark contrast to the significant declines in Mac and iPad sales, with Mac sales plummeting by nearly 34% over the year, highlighting the fierce competition and shifting consumer preferences in the tech industry.   On the financial front, Apple's revenue dipped slightly to $89.50 billion, a 1% decrease. However, the company's net income tells a more positive story, surging by 11% to $22.96 billion. The Q4 earnings report brought more good news, with earnings per share reaching $1.46, comfortably beating the $1.31 estimate and fueling a 1% gap up in stock price at market open, followed by a 2% rise at close.   Despite a tumultuous journey with a 16% drop from a July peak of $198, Apple's stock has rallied 36% over the year.

        "text": "Good morning everyone. Today, through a scenario analysis and the creation of a bond sentiment index, we will try to determine which between US or European bonds represent the best choice.   1. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF IBGM AND IEF   The ETFs at the center of our analysis are the iShares  Govt Bond 7-10 yr (IBGM) and the iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond (IEF). The IBGM, as illustrated in the following chart, reflects the price movement of government bonds from the five main European countries by GDP (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands) with maturities between 7 and 10 years and a duration of 7.79 years.   Ishares  Govt Bond 7-10yr. Weekly chart   Holdings. Source: iShares.com   The IEF, presented in the following figure, replicates the price changes of US treasury bonds with maturities between 7 and 10 years and a duration of 7.32 years.   Ishares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond. Weekly chart   Lets start the technical analysis of the two ETFs, starting with IBGM. Since May 11, 2023, the ETF has not recorded significant price changes. However, it is interesting to observe the formation of two contrasting technical figures: a descending triangle followed by an ascending triangle, both with breakout. The ETF has shown an uptrend since the beginning of the fourth quarter.   Technical analysis IBGM. Daily Chart   As for the IEF, the situation is different. This ETF has shown a more bearish trend compared to the IBGM: from May 4, 2023, to the minimum of October 19, at $88.86, it recorded a negative performance of -11.84%. In the last sessions, the price has made a bullish impulse, catalyzed by Powells statements (interpreted positively by the market) and a weakening of the US labor market (unemployment rate rose to 3.9% from the previous 3.8% and non-agricultural payrolls at 150K compared to the previous 297K).   Technical analysis IEF. Daily Chart   To determine which of the two ETFs is stronger, it is necessary to create a strength index between the two and observe the trend. We obtain the index by dividing the price of the IEF by that of the IBGM, as shown in the following chart. The trend of the IBGM/IEF index is strongly bullish since the end of April 2023, indicating greater strength of the IBGM (dividend) compared to the IEF (divisor).   The IBGM/IEF strenght index. Daily chart   This means that the European government bond market has been stronger than the US one since April 2023. But why?   2. MONETARY POLICY AND INTEREST RATES   The outperformance of European bonds compared to US ones is linked to the monetary policy expectations of the ECB and the FED. Starting from July, the market began to price a more restrictive FED compared to the ECB, as shown by the two following charts. It is known that the 2-year maturities of the yield curve are the ones most influenced by monetary policy expectations. As can be seen in the following chart, the 2-year yield of the US government bond shows an upward trend (despite the bearish breakout of the dynamic trendline after Powells statements), while the 2-year yield of the German bond is falling.   Differences in monetary policy expectations. Daily chart   This suggests that the more the US 2-year yield outperforms the German one at the same maturity, the more the market prices a more restrictive monetary policy in the US. In the following chart, we build a spread between the two yields (with US02Y as minuend and DE02Y as subtrahend) to highlight the differences between the monetary policy expectations of the two central banks. By correlating this spread with the previously created IBGM/IEF index, we can confirm what has been said: the IBGM appears stronger than the IEF because it is expected that European monetary policy will be more expansive compared to the US one.   The positive correlation between IBGM/IEF and US02Y-DE02Y. Daily chart   \"The US02Y-DE02Y index proves to be an excellent sentiment indicator to monitor in the near future, given its function as a leading indicator on monetary policy expectations. But what does the future hold for us?3   3. US AND EUROPEAN BONDS IN THE NEAR FUTURE   Which bonds should we focus on in the near future? Would it be better to focus on US or European government bonds? Lets start from a premise: the price of bonds tends to increase when interest rates are cut. So, the key questions to ask are:   Which of the two central banks will cut interest rates first? Which of the two has more incentives to keep rates higher for a longer period?   The answer is simple: it will depend on the current and future macroeconomic conditions of the two countries. Considering the current data, the United States has shown a quarterly GDP growth higher than that of Europe for the first, second and third quarter of the current year, as illustrated in the following chart:   United States and European gross domestic product. 3-Month chart   The American economy seems to show greater resilience. This is also highlighted in the following chart, which calculates the strength index between the manufacturing and service PMIs of the two countries. The two US PMIs have outperformed the European ones since the beginning of the year, indicating greater resilience of the sectors.   The manufacturing and service sectors in the United States are more resilient than those in Europe. Monthly chart   In the following figure, we consider retail sales data, which are an excellent indicator of the level of consumer spending in both the United States and Europe (considering also that consumption represents a significant part of the gross domestic product.   Retail sales data. Source: Trading Economics   The situation is positive for the United States, but much less promising for Europe. In the latter case, one could even argue that the data indicates a sort of recession, with two consecutive negative readings, and the last one, with a -1.2%, decidedly more negative than the previous one. We conclude with the analysis of industrial production data, as illustrated in the graph below. In the United States, we have noticed a trend of progressively lower readings compared to the previous year, with a single contraction recorded in June. Instead, as far as Europe is concerned, we have witnessed a drastic drop, with readings in contraction from March until the last available data.   Industrial production data. Source: Trading Economics   From the graphs in this paragraph, it is clear that Europe seems to be closer to a recession than the United States. As a result, at the moment, the FED has more incentives to keep rates higher for a longer period, while the ECB could be the first to cut interest rates (in fact, we must not forget that phase 1 of the economic cycle is characterized by expansive monetary policies). If this scenario were to occur, we could see an increase in purchases of European government bonds (particularly German ones, considered safe havens given Germanys high AAA rating), greater than those of the United States. But will this be the case next year? Its hard to predict. The macroeconomic picture is and will always be influenced by the trend of macroeconomic data. In this regard, I recommend keeping an eye on leading data, capable of anticipating future economic trends, including certainly the PMIs, without forgetting US02Y-DE02Y. To date, however, it seems that European bonds may have a higher competitive advantage. See you soon!",

        "text": "Caterpillar Inc (CAT) has recently demonstrated significant upside potential according to the latest technical analysis. Let's delve into key points supporting this positive outlook:   Recent Developments:   On October 31, 2023, CAT's stock price touched a critical support area at $228.37, marking its lowest level since June 2023. The significance of this level is reinforced by the presence of a long-term upward trendline dating back to March 2021. This underscores strong demand at this level, signaling the continuation of the upward trend.   Positive Reversal:   Following the support touch, CAT shares experienced a positive reversal by successfully breaking through the previous resistance level at $244.24 on November 3, 2023. This indicates an increased buying pressure, suggesting that CAT has the potential to continue its ascent to higher levels.   Target Price Set:   The proposed target price is around $290, reflecting the highest level reached in August 2023. This target selection is based on psychological aspects and the Highest level of all time   Momentum Indicator Support:   Two key momentum indicators, MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) and RSI (Relative Strength Index), provide positive signals:   MACD is above its signal line and the zero level, indicating that upward momentum is increasing, supporting the continuity of the uptrend.   RSI has moved above the 50 level and is approaching 70, suggesting that CAT may be in an overbought condition. This indicates a higher number of buyers than sellers, supporting the prediction of price increases.   Conclusion:   Based on this in-depth technical analysis, Caterpillar Inc (CAT) shows robust potential for upside movement. However, as with any investment decision, it is advisable to conduct further research and consider risk factors before making decisions.

A strategic position of going long on HAS and short on EA could take advantage of their distinct market positions and financial metrics.   Why Buy HAS:   Valuation   : HAS exhibits a P/E of 28.76, which compared to EAs 35.73, suggests a more modest market expectation and a potential undervaluation.   Dividend Yield   : HAS offers a dividend yield of 3.10%, which is substantially higher than EAs 0.57%, indicating a better return on investment through dividends.   Diversification and Stability   : HAS's broad product line, including toys and board games, may offer more stability against market downturns, especially in the volatile gaming sector.   Why Sell EA   :   Forward P/E   : EAs forward P/E of 16.65, while lower than its current P/E, might not fully capture potential risks in the gaming industry, including stiff competition and hit-driven volatility.   Short Interest   : EA has a short float of 1.23%, suggesting there is already some market skepticism about its current valuation which may support a short sell strategy.   Performance Metrics   : Despite recent upticks in performance, EA's historical EPS growth rate over the past five years was -2.89%, potentially indicating an underlying weakness.

The trading idea is to buy Pinterest stock (PINS) based on the provided facts.   Pinterest, Inc. has reported a total of $1.12 billion in short-term investments, indicating a strong financial position. Additionally, the company has a gross profit ratio of 77.59%, which measures how efficiently and effectively a company performs by dividing its gross profit by its total net sales. A high gross profit ratio suggests that Pinterest is performing well.   Furthermore, Pinterest has a low net debt of $-1 billion this quarter, indicating that the company has a solid financial foundation. Net debt is calculated by subtracting a company's total cash and cash equivalents from its total debt. A low net debt indicates that Pinterest has more assets than liabilities.   In terms of net income ratio, Pinterest is currently at 0.882%, which is a positive sign for investors. The net income ratio measures the profitability of a company by dividing its net income by its total net sales. A high net income ratio suggests that Pinterest is generating significant profits.   Overall, this trading idea fits a short investment horizon and a somewhat high risk tolerance. By investing in Pinterest stock, investors can take advantage of the company's strong financial position, solid gross profit ratio, low net debt, and positive net income ratio.   Technical Outlook   Pinterest bulls are focused on pushing the stock past a key resistance level at $29.22 as their next upside milestone, as long as they maintain their dominance. The bulls have been in control as indicated by the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) indicator, which is currently above +100, signifying that the market price is unusually high.   In today's trading session, Pinterest continued its upward trend, gaining a further 0.72% and reaching a stock price of $30.94. This marks the seventh consecutive day of gains for the stock.   Over the past five days, Pinterest's share price has appreciated by around 25.34%, outperforming the Nasdaq by a significant margin of 790.4% so far this year. The company has a market capitalization of $20.86 billion.   On Friday, the stock saw 12.93 million shares traded, slightly below the multi-day average of 13.53 million.   In technical analysis, Pinterest is currently rated as \"Neutral\" during this positive session, gaining 22 cents, or 0.72%. The CCI indicator, showing the market price is unusually high, supports the bullish sentiment.   Other notable movements in the market include a 1.39% increase in Alphabet, with a closing price of $130.37, a 1.6% increase in Comcast, and a 1.8% increase in Netflix on Friday.",

        "text": "AMD appears to have confirmed a technical breakout on the Daily chart.  The stock has experienced a meteoric rise since its last earnings report(10/30/23) moving over +20% in just a few short days.  This extremely BULLISH price action has not only been fueled by a great earnings report, but there is also a major news catalyst driving the stock price higher.  The catalyst has been strong enough to boost the price despite weak 'Q4 forward guidance. There are talks of a new AI chip that may allow them to compete with the likes of NVDA, the main player in the semiconductor industry.  AMD may never surpass NVDA in stature however, AI projects to be the biggest technological innovation since the implementation of the internet making being the second, or even third biggest player in the space not a bad spot to be in.  The need for semiconductors in general will most likely dominate the future resulting in plenty of profits to be made.   The recent price action of AMD is really a tale of earnings.  Zooming out to the Daily chart and this phenomenon can be easily identified.  The story really began with an earnings miss on 11/01/22.  A few days before the release of this report AMD would set what ultimately turned out to be its 52 wk Low.  This was preceded by a precipitous drop from the ATH of $164.46 set on 11/30/21.  This rise to a new ATH and subsequent fall to a new 52 wk Low ironically occurred during a streak of nine consecutive earnings beats.  Further analysis and one is able to discern that price action broke down over a series of DBL TOP patterns before recovering in a series of a DBL BTM patterns. This behavior may prove to be foreshadowing, but I digress.   Fast forward to 11/3/23 AMD has just closed above the neckline of a DBL BTM pattern, after completing a series of DBL TOP patterns, in the midst of four consecutive earnings beats.  History may not repeat itself, but it has a tendency to rhyme.  The stock has also broken through the top of a Descending Channel(D) that it has been trading in since the start of the series of DBL TOP patterns.  The upward momentum has been so strong that the stock broken and closed above the 200MA(D), 100MA(D), and 50MA(D) over just the last three trading sessions, making a new local high in the process.  The stock has been on a rocket ship since finding support at levels identified and explained in a previous idea(see AMD Earnings Breakout or Breakdown).   As for this idea.  The series of DBL TOP patterns is represented by the black curves above the would be tops, with their respective necklines identified by the small black circles seen on the chart.  The DBL BTM pattern is represented by the green curves found at the would be bottoms with the neckline also identified with a circle as well.  The red curves represent a failed DBL TOP even after a closing confirmation on the Daily chart below what would have been the neckline.  Proof that the markets can do anything at any time therefore, you can never let your guard down.  However, it should be noted that this failed DBL TOP pattern comes after two successfully executed DBL TOP patterns, and a third that could be considered successful depending on your perspective.  The third one just happened to occur near the 200MA(D) which has historically been strong support for any asset.  Regardless the diagnosis it still amounts to a series of successful BEARISH patterns that have begun to fail, possibly indicating BULLISH price action moving forward.   Bull Case   1.  Strength above $111.31.  If the DBL BTM pattern is to play out, this area would be the neckline of the formation.   2.  Strength above the top of the Descending Channel(D) in which the stock has been trading for the past three months or so.  The stock has closed above the top of the channel with momentum.  It would not be shocking to see the stock retest the top of the channel.   3.  A retest and bounce from the local low, creating a higher low.  This would be a BULLISH indication as the stock has already created a higher high signaling the potential start of an uptrend.   Bear Case   1.  Strong rejection at the stock's current levels.  Such price action could imply yet another DBL TOP formation, leading to further downward momentum.   2.  BEARISH price action, chart patterns, or strong rejection at the yellow rectangle drawn above the current price level.  This area represents the Golden Zone of a BEARISH Fib Retracement from the local high of $132.83 to the local low of $93.12.  This area serves as a strong area of resistance and could serve as a logical area of rejection.  Especially given how far and fast the stock has run since earnings.   3.  A break below the DBL BTM pattern all together.  This would be extremely BEARISH and could signal a falling knife situation.  Under these circumstances bias should switch to the downside and the stock should be monitored for short opportunities.   *As things currently stand, bias is to the upside, with a guilty until proven innocent approach.  The market has been extremely erratic, and rallies have been hard to trust.  The stock has only created its first higher high, after trading in a clear downtrend(a series of lower highs and lower lows).   *RSI(D) displays a DBL BTM formation that has been confirmed with a break of the neckline.   *Watching AVP(52 wk Low)(POC), Moving Averages(D), Descending Channel(D), Key Levels(black rectangles), Ascending Support(red trendline), Bollinger Bands(D), and the AVWAP(52 wk Low) at their respective levels for additional confluence.",

        "text": "What stocks do day traders trade? What stock types are more appropriate for swing traders? Selecting suitable stocks for trading requires an amalgamation of keen market understanding and thorough research. This process, while complex, is fundamental for traders aiming to navigate the ever-evolving financial markets with precision. Platforms like FXOpen provide traders with the tools and resources necessary to facilitate this selection, with instruments like TickTrader aiding in a more refined analysis. This article offers a structured approach to stock selection, encompassing various analytical techniques and considerations.   Understanding Your Trading Goals   Every trader has unique objectives shaping their strategies. While a young trader might aim for aggressive growth, those nearing retirement might focus on capital safety.   Consequently:   Growth-oriented traders are drawn to emerging companies with promising revenue growth, even if earnings vary, as they provide a high level of volatility.   Those emphasising capital preservation opt for long-standing firms known for steady profits.   Defining Your Trading Approach   Your trading approach will determine the stocks you can trade:   Short-Term:   This is where understanding how to research stocks for day trading becomes essential. This period, which can last anywhere from a few moments to a few days, is ideal for traders who are looking for rapid market movements. Emerging equities and penny stocks may be an ideal option.   Medium-Term:   Traders who choose medium-term trading lasting anywhere from weeks to months pay attention to securities whose value highly depends on sector trends or company-specific developments that could affect their value in the near future.   Long-Term:   This investment timeframe extends over years. Although its not common for traders to keep trades open for such long periods, they may choose stocks with promising growth potential supported by solid company fundamentals.   Are you scouting for the best day trading stocks today, or are you more intrigued by swing trading? With platforms like FXOpen, traders can optimally navigate the markets on chosen timeframes.   Risk Tolerance Assessment   If you are looking for the best stocks for trading, it's crucial to assess the level of risk you're comfortable with in relation to your entire trading capital. Risk tolerance can be categorised into different profiles, such as conservative, moderate, or aggressive:   Conservative approach:   priority for capital preservation and lower-risk investments.   Moderate approach:   a trader may take some risk but still prefer a balanced approach.   Aggressive approach:   higher levels of risk for potentially higher returns.   Understand Stock Types   Stocks can be categorised into various types based on their risk profiles, such as:   Blue-chips:   Generally considered less risky and associated with established financially stable companies.   Growth:   Offers the potential for higher returns but comes with higher volatility and risk.   Value:   Tend to be less volatile and may appeal to more conservative traders.   Fundamental Analysis   Fundamental analysis provides the map for a stock trading journey, using financial statements and key ratios to decode a company's performance and potential.   Evaluating Financial Statements   Income Statement:   This vital document illuminates the revenue, expenses, and profits, acting as a window into a company's profitability over a specific period. By examining it, traders discern how the company generates profits and manages its operating expenses.   Balance Sheet:   Acting as a financial snapshot, the balance sheet reveals a company's assets and liabilities at a particular point in time. It provides insights into the company's net worth and financial resilience.   Cash Flow Statement:   A crucial tool for traders, it traces the journey of cash as it enters and exits the company. More than just profitability, this statement underscores the company's liquidity, showing how well it manages its cash resources.   Analysing Key Financial Ratios:   Ratios like P/E, Debt-to-Equity, and ROE offer profound insights into a company's valuation, leverage, and profitability, respectively.   Assessing the Company's Industry and Market Position:   Understanding the industry trends and the company's standing within its sector provides context. Does the company lead its peers, or does it follow?   Identifying Potential Catalysts:   A product launch, merger, or even macroeconomic factors can serve as catalysts, inducing stock price movements.   Technical Analysis   Technical analysis deciphers stock price movements through historical trends and patterns, enabling traders to base decisions on past data over speculation.   Reading Stock Charts   By analysing chart patterns and technical indicators, you can identify the best stocks with precise entry and exit points, increasing the likelihood of effective trades. For example, if you're looking to learn how to find stocks to day trade, understanding and utilising candlestick patterns can be an incredibly useful tool.   Using Technical Indicators   Technical indicators allow traders to determine the assets with the most promising price movements. Whether you are a day trader or keep trades open for weeks, technical analysis tools will help build a strong trading strategy.   Volume Analysis   Every stock movement is driven by the forces of supply and demand. Volume analysis helps to understand this by shedding light on a stock's trading activity. A surge in volume could indicate a growing interest in a stock, while dwindling volumes could suggest fading enthusiasm. This metric is essential, especially when identifying the best stocks to day trade.   Market Sentiment Analysis   Market sentiment analysis offers a deep dive into traders' collective perceptions, providing insight into their outlook on particular stocks or the market as a whole. Such insights often serve as the vital link between analytical data and the real-world trading environment.   Understanding Market Sentiment:   Recognising the market's overall sentiment can be invaluable. For instance, a predominantly bullish sentiment on a blue-chip stock after a strong earnings report might indicate a potential upward trend.   Monitoring News and Events:   External events, such as an unexpected CEO resignation or geopolitical tensions, can drastically impact stock prices. Staying updated can prepare traders for sudden market shifts.   Social Media Sentiment Analysis:   Platforms like Twitter can be goldmines of trader sentiment. A sudden spike in tweets about a tech company following a product launch, for example, might hint at market excitement.   Sentiment Indicators and Tools:   Several tools, such as those on platforms like TickTrader, offer sentiment metrics. Tracking market volume is a logical way to measure market sentiment. Large market volumes are a good indicator of how the market feels about a particular security.   Screening for Trading Candidates   Traders need a systematic approach to identify the most suitable stocks for their strategy in order to navigate the vast sea of options available. Effective screening can be the difference between capitalising on an opportunity and missing it entirely.   Liquidity ensures traders can promptly enter or exit trades. Typically, blue-chip stocks have higher liquidity than small-cap stocks.   Volatility represents price fluctuations. High volatility can provide more short-term trading chances, but it comes with risks. For instance, emerging industry stocks tend to be more volatile.   Price Trends track stocks with steady trajectories. A stock frequently hitting its 52-week high may suggest a sustained bullish trend.   Stock Screeners and Tools: With modern tech, traders use stock screeners to filter stocks that match their criteria, streamlining the selection process.   Conclusion   Choosing stocks requires a careful mix of insight, study, and instinct. As markets change, being informed and adaptable remains crucial.

Although we ultimately place SPY hitting $399 in the near future as a high probability, we do see yet another rug-pull event that has taken place at the $429 price target on a smaller timeframe:   This is confluent with a weak bullish divergence that is appearing on the Daily chart.  This supports the thesis that a bounce to the $430 area will occur before we ultimately sell-off down to $400.   Ultimately we see many bearish factors as we enter what is traditionally a bullish time of the year.

This support level has been tested and held on multiple occasions, providing a strong foundation for this indicator. In addition,   AAPL   also has historical support for the 50MA (weekly timeframe). This confluence of support levels (On different timeframes) suggest that AAPL is well-positioned to break through the resistance level found at $175 (figure B).   A Fibonacci retracement analysis of AAPL's recent price action indicates valid levels at 61.8% and 78.6%. These levels provide a valid signal to the stock's upside momentum.   My current buy zone for AAPl is set between $143 & $134 should the stock have a downturn. This zone provides a good entry point as it is right above AAPL's support (figure A) and within our FIB retracement levels mentioned above.   Overall, the technical analysis for AAPl is positive.

It is written on the wall that the tech sector regulations in China is over and a new chapter has begin in 2023 onwards. The Central government will now have a stake in these tech giants in a way to control their monopolistic behaviour.   The platform business, e-commerce, live commerce, internet related sectors are all too important in China and it is only in the interest of China to continue to invest and grow this sector exponentially. It could be the first sector to pull China out of its doldrums and spearhead its bearish GDP figures last year. Now, with the travel ban lifted up, we will witness the hospitality sectors picking up the lowest hanging fruits.   Do not forget, bookings of flights , hotels, payment gateway are all digitalised now so those operators behind these industry like Alipay, Tencent, Trip.com, etc will be the main beneficiaries.

TBH, I'm not totally sure how it plays out yet, it's one of those moments where you have to keep reanalyzing in real time to adjust prices and trends.   I can say with some certainty that there is a pretty good price drop coming, and I think I've identified the trend that will cause it (hot pink). I would watch for a trend break on that trend.   If it played out like this, it wouldn't surprise me, but obviously, I would rely more on the trends and price targets vs the arrow path.   Good luck!   Honestly, if you miss a short entry on a steep drop, instead of jumping in way too late, consider a 3x leveraged ticker and buy in the bullish direction. Realize your profits, and you'll make just as much. LONG TERM is favored for bulls until some major trends break or WW3 starts. I have other charts that cover those projections.",

For the patient investors, you can wait for the breakout to happen first before deciding to go long. This could be a long haul as we hope to see investors slowly gaining more confidence in the stock market and start to invest again. Hopefully, the property market which is still in a doldrum has affected many people who strongly believes in the ever rising property prices. It may last for years but eventually, it has come to a stop and those who caught off guard and went a little too greedy with excess speculations got themselves burned with higher interest rates and could not service the mortgage and has to force sell the properties at a loss.

        "date": "2023-11-05 18:39:46",
        "text": "1. Study.   Learn how financial markets work. Years ago I took Khan Academy's free courses on the financial markets. It really helped reinforce what I already knew, taught me new stuff and solidified my confidence in understanding how the financial markets work. Here's the link:   www.khanacademy.org/...-domain/core-finance   Learn the basics of Technical Analysis. For this part I read \"Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets\" by John Murphy. I read the whole book not once, but twice, and I constantly refer to it to refresh my memory. You can also get the supplemental workbook to do exercises and test your proficiency. Link:   www.amazon.com/Techn...ensive/dp/0735200661   Learn the basics of Macroeconomics and Microeconomics. Khan Academy also provides excellent free courses in this subject area with quizzes and tests to confirm your proficiency. This part is important for understanding the big picture.  Link:   www.khanacademy.org/...omics-finance-domain   2. Develop a trading plan.   Write out your trading plan step-by-step and follow it every time. If you don't do this, you won't be consistently profitable in the long term. Never trade on a whim, even if you fear missing out on a big move. I would rather miss out on a big move up because I took the time to develop a plan than jump in without a plan and experience a big move down. Here's a good resource for how to develop a trading plan:   www.ig.com/en/tradin...-trading-plan-181210   3. Find a trading mentor.   Find someone who is more experienced than you and learn from them. I was able to connect with a very experienced trader here on Trading View with whom I share watchlists and get trade ideas from. We chat regularly and confirm or critique each other's ideas. Having a trading mentor has been invaluable to my trading. It's important to find someone who is trustworthy and competent, and willing to critique your trading ideas. Often we as traders only see what we want to see in the chart and miss or ignore obvious clues that go against our theory. For example, what one person sees as a triple bottom (bullish) another person may see as a bear flag (bearish).   Another way to learn from other traders is to subscribe to traders who post high-quality content on Youtube. I subscribe to a few great trading Youtubers who give me all kinds of insights. My trading has definitely improved because of learning from other traders. With this said, don't go overboard. Find just a couple of good people to follow. You don't want to follow dozens and dozens of traders as you will suffer from information overload.   4. Manage risk.   Preserving your capital is necessary to stay in the game, so you need to manage risk. No matter how good your charting may be, some of your trades will go against you and will need to get out. That's why I always use stop losses and get out of a trade at a certain predetermined level. Stop losses always limit loss, but do not necessary limit profit. This in turn allows you to only be right half of the time (or in some cases even less) and still be profitable. The topic of stop losses actually warrants it own discussion. In the future, I will be writing a post on how to place your stop losses.   Other risk management strategies include: limiting the amount of margin you use, only risking a certain percentage of your portfolio on any given trade, and diversifying your portfolio. A key difference between trading and investing is that investing does not (typically) employ stop losses. Long-term investors typically manage risk by using diversification.   5. Be humble.   Check your ego at the door. It does not matter if you're right. The only thing that matters is your money. Never stay in a trade because you don't want to admit that you were wrong. I've seen plenty of charts that looked amazing and then a black swan event happens. Perhaps one of the best ways to think about it is to consider this paraphrased statement from the legendary trader Larry Williams: \"Regardless of past performance, never forget that every new trade you make only has a 50% chance of success.\" I have seen some Trading View users who are completely consumed by pride and post their win rates and super high-profit percentages. I steer clear of these traders because they fail one major rule of good trading: staying humble. Past performance is not a guarantee of future performance.   6. Keep a journal.   This one is very important. Whenever I learn something new about trading, I write it down in a trading notebook. Whenever I make a mistake, I write down what went wrong and what I learned from the mistake. My trading notebook contains my strategies both for bear markets and bull markets, contains the steps for my daily routine, contains my screener criteria, and contains a listing of all the important things I've picked up over the years of trading.   7. Track your assets.   Employ some kind of a method for tracking your performance. Even though it's time-consuming, I use a spreadsheet.   8. Avoid speculation.   Never trade based on speculation or emotion. Never buy or sell an asset because of fear (whether fear of a market crash or fear of missing out on a huge rally). Never enter into a position simply because you like the company, and similarly do not avoid selling your position because you love the company too much. The most successful traders are rigorously unemotional and unattached. In my opinion, I define anything that does not involve an analysis of data as speculation.   I have also come to learn that by the time everyone is talking about something, it is usually at peak mania and will not go up further. For example, when your co-worker or close friend is talking about how much they made from Bitcoin, it's probably time to sell. Similarly, if you see everyone on social media posting photos of how much it costs to fill up their car with gas, it probably means we're at the peak of gas prices.   9. Learn how to use your charting platform.   One of the best things I ever did to master my charting was to spend a few weeks doing nothing but just learning all the features on Trading View. When I first signed up for Trading View I was overwhelmed by all the tools, indicators, strategies, and ideas on here. So I knew I had to take a timeout from trading and just learn the tools first. For several weeks rather than focus on trading, I focused on learning Trading View. I favorited indicators that work best for my strategy, I created layouts and explored every nook and cranny on the platform. Trading View is incredibly powerful because it provides access to so much data. Having access to data is power. By taking the time to learn how to use all of its tools, I was able master the financial markets to a degree that I can now make predictions just good as those high-paid Wall Street analysts. Your subscription will pay for itself through the profits you make.   10. \"Look first. Then leap.\"   Always chart out your entry point, stop loss, and profit target before entering a trade. Ask yourself: How much risk am I willing to take for how much profit?   Here's a great resource from Investopedia that inspired this post:   www.investopedia.com...ules-for-trading.asp   This list of good trading rules is nowhere near comprehensive, so please leave a comment below to share your rules and tips for successful trading!",

The ETF boasts a dividend yield of 1.5736%, with a return of 7.15% over the past year, slightly outpacing the SPY's return of 6.52%.   A technical analysis suggests that VOO is currently in a complete impulse wave pattern, having concluded a corrective phase within its smaller cycle structure. The RSI indicator is nearing the overbought territory on the 4-hour chart, signaling a potential minor price retracement in the short term, which is a natural part of the upward trend.   On the daily chart, the MACD indicator has started to rebound from its lows, indicating a reduction in bearish momentum. Additionally, prices have maintained above the 200-day moving average, signaling positive momentum. A weekly chart review clearly suggests an upcoming bullish market reversal within the next year. The first resistance target is anticipated around $515, with a secondary target near $635.78. The diminishing bearish momentum in the MACD indicator, coupled with the RSI breaking above resistance levels, suggests a hold position on VOO would be prudent.

        "text": "Coinbase shares are up 35% since the SEC sued the crypto exchange for allegedly selling unregistered securities   But Coinbase stock has bounced back, rising some 35% after dropping to a low of about $50 on the day that the SEC sued the U.S.s largest crypto exchange. As of Wednesday morning, shares were trading near $70, and the publicly traded companys market capitalization has risen to about $16.5 billion.   The resurgence of Coinbase mirrors the broader boomerang of the crypto market in June, riding a Wall Streetfueled fever for Bitcoin that has lifted other cryptocurrencies and injected optimism into an industry that was reeling from a battery of enforcement from the federal government.   The Coinbase stock has been rallying, the price of Bitcoin has been rallying, and then these two things usually play off of each other. Specifically, Bitcoins resurgence is tied to BlackRocks recent filing of an application for Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund, a surprising vote of confidence from the US.s largest asset manager in the worlds largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.   Shortly after BlackRocks application became public, the price of Bitcoin soared, notching its highest price in more than a year as a slew of other asset managers filed applications for Bitcoin spot ETFs, potentially opening up the cryptocurrency to trillions in dollars from brokerage accounts and pension funds.   And where Bitcoin goes, so goes the broader market, as the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies jumped from just about $1 trillion to now about $1.17 trillion.   BlackRocks ETF filing was not only a vote of confidence in Bitcoin but also Coinbase. Its application listed the publicly traded crypto exchange as the custodian for holding the trusts underlying Bitcoin.   For them to continue and list Coinbase as a custodian for their ETF was a strong signal that these SEC allegations are not that big of a deal   I think the market is telling usthe worst is behind us, as far as U.S. regulatory crackdown is concerned",

        "text": "Dear Esteemed Members of the TradingView Community,   I   n our continuous pursuit of precision, we've harnessed the analytical power of cutting-edge AI technology, utilizing a harmonious blend of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL) methodologies to decode the market trends from June 26, 2023, to November 4, 2023.   O   ur AI indicates a prevailing bearish sentiment in this time frame, which traditionally corresponds to a sequence of lower lows. The chart exhibits a prominent white trendline, gracefully outlining the descending support trajectory of this bearish trend and pinpointing potential regions for the emergence of new lower lows. Should this trendline remain intact, a target price range for short positions spans from $175 to $195.   F   or those contemplating entry into a short position, we suggest closely monitoring the nearest resistance levels. In bearish trends, historical support levels often transition into formidable resistance points. To map these potential hurdles, the AI has nimbly employed the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm, highlighting two key resistance zones: \"Resistance 1\" and \"Resistance 2.\" Resistance 1, marked by the vibrant red line, stands as the immediate barricade, while Resistance 2, also vividly red, awaits in the wings should Resistance 1 be breached. These insights have inspired us to craft two scenarios for your strategic consideration.   I   n Scenario 1, we envisage Resistance 1 rejecting the price action, ushering in a descent towards the coveted target price zone. In Scenario 2, an alternate narrative unfolds, where the bulls surge past Resistance 1, eventually carving out a consolidation phase between the two resistance lines. Ultimately, this tactical hiatus is followed by an ebbing of market enthusiasm, permitting the anticipated descent into the target zone.   A   perceptive examination of the volume reveals an uptick in selling pressure on TSLA, commencing on October 17, 2023. The red volume candles in the white circle signify an influx of market sell transactions, surpassing the norm. This pattern aligns with a prevailing bearish sentiment, setting the stage for a potential decline in keeping with our bearish expectations.   W   hile on the indicators, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) appears. It's a tool often wielded together with others by seasoned traders. Although we've already discussed various indicators, it's worth casting an eye over the RSI. The RSI is signaling a persistent selling inclination in the market, displaying no discernible signs of waning. When considered in conjunction with the volume data and AI-derived insights, it further bolsters the case for impending bearish continuations.   tl;dr version:   T   o sum up, here's a snapshot of the elements of our analysis:   Position: Short   Trend: Bearish   Entry: Near Resistance 1 or Resistance 2 (depicted in red)   Target Price Zone: $175-$195   Stop Loss: Positioned above the noted resistances   Indicators: ARIMA, STL, K-NN, Volume Candle Analytics, Trendline Analytics, RSI   H   owever, please be mindful that this analysis is not an investment advice. Past performance is not indicative of future results. The trading parameters should be in line with your unique risk tolerance. It's crucial to undertake your individual research and remember to implement a range of safeguards, such as Stop Loss, Trail Profit, Target Price, Trade Timeout, and Liquidity Check. The ever-fluctuating market can often spring surprises, venturing into scenarios that may differ significantly from those outlined in this analysis.   Warm regards,   Ely",

        "text": "Although Bitcoin mining stocks are outperforming the market so far this year, they have been on a steady decline since early August. Riot Platforms, Inc. (Nasdaq: RIOT) is one of these stocks that have been hit hard as its stock is down nearly 45% from the highs it reached last July. That said, this dip could be an opportunity to go long on the stock ahead of 2 major Bitcoin catalysts that should boost the cryptocurrencys price. The first catalyst is the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs as analysts expect the SEC to approve spot ETF applications later this year. In addition, we are approaching the Bitcoin halving which has seen the cryptocurrency spike after the past 3 halvings. Given our $20 price target on RIOT stock, investors may find the current levels an attractive entry point into the Bitcoin miners stock.   RIOT Fundamentals   Bitcoin Tailwinds Will Help Miners Rebound   While some investors believe holding Bitcoin may be the best strategy to participate in this sector, Bitcoin miners have proven to provide higher returns. On a YTD basis, Bitcoin is up 84.5%, while RIOT stock more than tripled gaining nearly 155% over the same period. This isnt exclusive to Riot only as other miners like Marathon (Nasdaq: MARA) and Hut 8 (Nasdaq: HUT) are also up by 117% and 118%, respectively.   As such, investing in Bitcoin miners, especially after their massive drop since early August, could be opportune as it seems likely that Bitcoin is heading into a major bull market. The most important catalyst for Bitcoin is the upcoming halving that is expected to occur next April. This event is significant since the supply output will be cut in half which means that block rewards will decrease from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.   With that in mind, Bitcoin prices have historically benefited from halving events as data shows that the cryptocurrencys price spiked before the previous 3 halvings. This is due to Bitcoins inflation rate declining with every halving. Before the first halving, Bitcoin surged by as much as 234% since the start of 2012 until the event occurred on November 8.   However, a bigger movement occurred after the halving where Bitcoin increased by more than 9400%, reaching a then all-time high of $1165 in November 2013.   The second halving occurred on July 9, 2016, and in the year prior to the event, Bitcoin increased by as much as 400%.   Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency surged more than 2948% in the year after the halving before entering a bear market.   This trend also occurred prior to the third halving that occurred on May 11, 2020. Over the year prior to the event, Bitcoin increased by as much as 291%.   Following the occurrence of the event, Bitcoin went on to reach its all-time high, increasing by 690% in the process in November 2021, before entering the crypto winter of 2022.   That being said, Bitcoin appears to be on the same trajectory since the cryptocurrency is currently up nearly 100% from the lows it reached in November 2022.   However, it should be noted that these major runs take time to materialize, so Bitcoin price may not be impacted by the halving event immediately.   The other major catalyst for Bitcoin is the likely SEC approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC has previously denied applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, its stance may change after a Court of Appeals ruled that the SEC was wrong to reject Grayscales (GBTC) proposed Bitcoin ETF, a ruling the SEC decided not to appeal.   The SECs decision likely paves the way for the approval of other spot Bitcoin ETFs, including Grayscaless. As is, House lawmakers recently urged the SEC to approve all outstanding applications immediately, in a letter sent by 4 members of the House Financial Services Committee to SEC Chair Garry Gensler.   Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts expect the SEC to approve spot Bitcoin ETF applications before January 10, 2024. This is mainly due to major institutions filing their applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs including BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark Invest, Invesco, Valkyrie, and others. Given the size of these institutions, Morgan Creek Capitals CEO  Mark Yusko  expects the approval of spot ETFs to result in an influx of $300 billion into Bitcoin.   This projection could lead to a major run in Bitcoin price considering that the percentage of total Bitcoin supply held by long-term investors is at an all-time high at 80.34%. This is mainly due to the expected demand outpacing the amount of Bitcoin available to trade.   RIOTs Edge   Although the aforementioned catalysts will certainly impact all Bitcoin miners, Riot is well-positioned to benefit the most due to its sound margins and cost management. According to its latest Q2 earnings report, Riots average cost of mining is $8,389 per Bitcoin. In comparison, its competitor Marathon had an average cost of $18,873 per Bitcoin, more than double that of Riot. These elevated costs are impacting Marahons gross margin which was 33.3% in the first half of the year, while Riots mining operations had a gross margin of 53.4% over the same period, despite having lower production.   That said, a reason why Riot is operating more efficiently is that it operates in Texas. Thanks to the states unregulated electricity market, consumers are allowed to sell unused energy to the grid. As such, Riot can earn power curtailment credits to offset costs which is extremely helpful when energy costs are more profitable than mining operations.   Riot has already utilized this advantage as it received $31.7 million last August by providing 84 thousand megawatt hours of energy to the market in Texas to reduce overall demand, lower consumer prices, and stabilize the grid during a heatwave. The miner also received $13.5 million in credits in September due to the same reasons which are the equivalent of mining 511 Bitcoin based on the average price of Bitcoin in September.   Another advantage of operating in Texas is the lower power costs as the average Texas commercial electricity rate is 9.07 /kWh  nearly 31% lower than the national average of 13.11 /kWh, per the US Energy Information Administration.   Given Riots impressive cost structure, it appears to be ready to face the challenges brought by the upcoming Bitcoin Halving. While the halving will potentially have a positive impact on Bitcoin prices, that may not be the case for all miners. Some investors argue that the increased rate of mining difficulty brought about by the halving will lead to more costs for miners.   While this point is valid to a degree, it should be noted that Bitcoins price has historically increased in the months leading to the Bitcoin halving as discussed earlier. As such, the amount of Bitcoin needed to be mined to be profitable is also less.   Therefore, having a lower electricity cost than competitors starts to become a major competitive advantage for Riot since its power costs are less than most miners due to its location in Texas. In this way, its margins could further improve in case Bitcoin goes on a similar run leading to the upcoming halving as it did the past 3 halvings.   Price Target   With its stock trading at $11.39, Riot may be undervalued at current levels. Since the miner doesnt have any long-term debt on its balance sheet, its book value amounts to more than $1.2 billion. This means that at its latest reported outstanding share count of 185.3 million, its book value per share is $6.7, leading to a P/B ratio of 1.7. Considering that an adequate P/B ratio is 3, Riot should be trading at $20.09, representing a 76.3% upside.   Total Assets\t$1,358,930,000   Total Liabilities\t$118,020,000   Book Value\t$1,240,910,000   OS\t185,305,831   BVPS\t$6.70   Share Price\t$11.39   P/B Ratio\t1.70   Projected Share Price\t$20.09   Risks   There are 2 major risks to the bullish thesis on RIOT stock. The first risk is Bitcoin prices not increasing as anticipated due to the upcoming halving. That could have catastrophic impacts on miners since they would realize less revenue while their costs would increase due to the greater mining difficulty. As a result, any chance of Riot becoming profitable would be non-existent.   The second risk to the bullish thesis is if the SEC doesnt approve the spot Bitcoin ETF applications next year as analysts expect. Despite the court ruling in favor of Grayscale in its case against the SEC, it doesnt guarantee that the commission will approve the applications it has on hand. As such, this could be an issue that requires an intervention by lawmakers to set frameworks for spot Bitcoin ETFs.   Technical Analysis   On the hourly chart, RIOT stock is in a neutral trend as it is trading in a sideways channel between $10.3 and $12. Looking at the indicators, the stock is above the 200, 50, and 21 MAs which is a bullish signal. However, the RSI is overbought at 70 and the MACD is approaching a bearish crossover. Based on this, the stock may retest its $10.3 support as profit-taking occurs which could be an ideal entry point for bullish investors.   As for the fundamentals, RIOT stock appears to be a bargain at current levels given its potential to reach $20. Such an increase in the stocks value would be mainly driven by the anticipated increase in Bitcoin price due to the upcoming SEC decision on spot Bitcoin ETFs and the halving that is expected to occur next April. Therefore, crypto bulls may find RIOT stock to be attractively valued at current levels given Bitcoin miners history of outperforming Bitcoin in terms of percentage gains.   RIOT Forecast   To conclude, Riot is well-positioned to capitalize on a potential Bitcoin rally ahead of the upcoming halving next April which could be fueled by the SEC approving spot Bitcoin ETFs. The reason why Riot may benefit the most from these catalysts is its industry-leading average cost per mined Bitcoin which is the result of its lower power costs since it operates in Texas. This advantage will be more important when the Bitcoin halving occurs since the more difficult mining difficulty will lead miners to incur more costs. With no debt on its balance sheet, RIOT stock should be trading near $20.09 based on its BVPS and P/B ratio, which is why the current share price could be an attractive entry point into the promising Bitcoin miner.",

        "text": "As were heading into earnings season, one report investors are anticipating is fintech startup Upstart Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: UPST). While the startup beat analysts expectations in its Q2 earnings, its stock is down 45% since then due to an underwhelming guidance resulting from macroeconomic pressures. With the fintech holding $837.5 million in loans on its balance sheet and delinquency rates rising near pre-pandemic levels, Upstart may suffer in the coming quarters as the macro conditions arent expected to improve anytime soon. In light of this, were downgrading our earlier hold rating on UPST stock to a sell.   UPST Fundamentals   Too Many Macro Challenges   Since inflation skyrocketed and the Fed started hiking rates, Upstart has witnessed fewer loans to approve. This resulted in its volume plunging, taking revenue and profits along with it. Originally, one of the fintechs main attractions was that it doesnt have the same exposure to economic fluctuations since it isnt a bank. However, this view has been proven wrong by its financial performance this year as loan originations across its platform declined 64% YoY in Q2 to 109,447 loans totaling nearly $1.2 billion. This slow demand for loans has led the companys revenues to decline 54.4% YoY in the first half of the year.   This headwind may continue impacting Upstart in the near term since while the Fed held interest rates flat in recent meetings, it signaled that it could further hike rates if inflation remains high. This would hinder the economy by curbing demand for new loans, and as a result, further impact the companys ability to generate revenue. It is for this reason that Upstart may report underwhelming Q3 earnings on November 7th, especially since the average interest rate in Q3 was 5.42% compared to 5.17% in Q2. Additionally, high interest rates could lead to more delinquencies in the future which would severely impact the company in my opinion.   Upstarts aim is to provide borrowers with fair credit  of at least 600  access to personal loans by looking beyond their credit history. Instead, the fintech considers other non-traditional credit indicators like college education, job history, and residence. As a result, its platform is considered a good option for customers who dont have a credit score that qualifies them for more inexpensive loans. In exchange for providing such a service for these consumers, Upstart charges origination, late, unsuccessful payment, and paper copy fees.   During the current macro environment, banks have been tightening their lending standards for both businesses and households, and they anticipate maintaining this cautious approach for the rest of the year, according to a survey conducted by the Fed. As such, lower quality borrowers or subprime borrowers that real banks dont want have to lean on platforms like Upstart for their personal loans.   With that in mind, delinquency rates in the US are on the rise with them approaching pre-pandemic levels at 2.36% for all loans, according to latest data from the Fed. Meanwhile, delinquency rates (60 days or more past due) for personal loans reached 3.62% in Q2, according to LendingTree. Considering that subprime borrowers are more likely to miss payments or default on their loans than borrowers with better credit, Upstart appears to be in a tough position, especially with the resumption of student loan repayments last month.   To fully understand the extent of this on Upstart, investors should note that during the first half of 2023, 38% of the loans funded through its platform were retained by its lending partners, and 50% of the loans were sold to institutional investors through its loan funding program. Meanwhile, the company retained 12% of the loans originated through its platform.   This represents an increase from the 10% it retained at the end of 2022 which shows that institutional investors as well as its partners are becoming more cautious about purchasing its loans. If this trend continues in the coming quarters, it would represent a major threat to the company due to its weak balance sheet.   Risky Actions May Backfire   While banks are negatively impacted by high interest rates due to higher delinquency and default rates, they also benefit from them due to the higher interest they charge on their loans. This isnt the case with Upstart since it isnt a bank. While the startup started carrying around $1 billion in debt on its balance sheet, its balance sheet isnt strong enough to handle this risk, especially since it only has $443.6 million in cash on hand.   As is, Upstart is dependent on funding from its partners to fund the loans originated through its platform. Earlier this year, the fintech secured $2 billion in funding over a 12-month period from its partners to support its loan originations.   Moreover, the startup isnt profitable yet and is barely generating operating cash flow as it generated only $86.6 million from operations in the first half of the year. This means that in case the loans its holding on its balance sheet go sour, there might be risks surrounding its ability to continue operating.   However, the biggest risk facing Upstart may be the contractual derivative risk in its committed capital partnership where it is forced to invest capital with its partners, exposing its capital to exposure of losses on a larger pool of loans its partners are purchasing. The company describes this investment as beneficial interests in its Q2 earnings report. This arrangement may appear similar to holding ABS securities, however, ABS securities have a yield spread protecting the equity, which is not available in this arrangement.   In Q2, Upstart reported that it had $40.2 million invested in risk-sharing as part of its committed capital arrangements to support $742.9 million in loans. As this amounts to an 18:1 leverage ratio, the companys equity would be hit hard in case of losses on this investment. Currently, the company projects this investment to be worth $51.7 million with the potential to be worth between $0 and $83.4 million over time, dependent on future credit performance.   Given that delinquency rates are on the rise as mentioned earlier, the company may see a loss on its investment if the economy takes more than anticipated to normalize. As is, the Fed projects the federal funds rate to be around 5% at the end of 2024, as shared in the Summary of Economic Projections last month.   At the same time, it remains unknown whether the company will invest more capital to support committed originations. In that case, its balance sheet will be burdened with a lot of highly leveraged exposure amid a possible recession next year.   Valuation   In terms of valuation, we can start with the value of the companys balance sheet. At the end of Q2, Upstart had $1.76 billion in assets and $1.12 billion in liabilities. This means that the net value of its assets is $638.14 million which puts its P/B ratio at 3.83. With that in mind, value investors prefer the P/B ratio to be under 3 which could indicate that the stock may be overvalued at its current valuation.   Assets\t$1,763,712,000   Liabilities\t$1,125,567,000   Net Assets\t$638,145,000   OS\t83,887,658   BVPS\t$7.61   Share Price\t$29.17   P/B Ratio\t3.83   Since Upstart is unprofitable, we can also use forward P/S to value its shares. Typically, investors prefer this ratio to be below 2, however, they may pay more for fast-growing companies. Currently, Upstart is trading at 4.6 forward P/S, and while it may not seem to be an unreasonable valuation, the companys revenues are declining substantially as it reported a 44.3% YoY revenue decline in Q2.   Based on these metrics, a $15 price target could be given to UPST stock, implying a 50% downside from current levels.   Upside Risks   Despite the bearish thesis on UPST stock, there are upside risks that investors should consider. If the Fed starts cutting rates earlier than anticipated, the company may be well-positioned to see a positive return on its risk-sharing arrangement which could bolster its financial position. Moreover, institutional investors and the fintechs partners may increase the amount of loans they purchase which would decrease the amount of loans it carries on its balance sheet  reducing credit risk.   Upstarts loans have been performing better in recent quarters. While the fintechs loans were underperforming in 2021 and 2022, the expected gross realized returns increased from 3.5% in Q1 2022 to 11.5% in Q1 2023, according to its Q2 earnings presentation. If the companys loans continue demonstrating strong performance, banks may become more willing to work with it.   Technical Analysis   On the hourly chart, UPST stock is in a neutral trend as it is trading in a sideways channel between $25.82 and $30.62. Looking at the indicators, the stock is above the 200, 50, and 21 MAs which is a bullish sign. Despite this, the RSI is overbought at 82 and the MACD is curling bearishly, indicating a possible reversal in the trend soon.   As for the fundamentals, Upstarts upcoming Q3 earnings report on November 7 is a major catalyst as it will determine the extent of the macro environments impact on the fintechs operations, as well as shedding light on its risk-sharing agreement. Since there has not been much improvement in the macro environment in Q3 compared to Q2, it is likely that Upstart will report another underwhelming earnings report.   Given that the stock is trading near resistance, investors may find the current PPS a good entry point to start a short position in the stock ahead of its Q3 earnings. Take profits could be found on retests of the $25 support, $22 support, and $15 price target with a stop loss near $32.2 if it breaks resistance.   UPST Forecast   After looking more into Upstarts Q2 results, we decided to revisit our earlier hold rating on UPST stock. As is, the macro environment is proving to be too difficult for the fintech to operate due to the rising delinquency rates which has led to the company retaining a larger portion of the loans it originates. Currently, the startup is holding loans worth $837.5 million on its balance sheet which could be a ticking time bomb if the trend of rising delinquency rates continues in the coming quarters. This could also impact the $40.2 million invested in risk-sharing as part of its committed capital arrangements. If this figure increases in the upcoming Q3 earnings report, the startups balance sheet would be exposed to high leverage in the midst of a recessionary environment, which doesnt bode well for it since its balance sheet is already weak. Given our $15 price target on UPST stock, taking a short position in the stock may prove to be a profitable decision.",

Update:   Same as the broad market, the bottoming happened a bit earlier than I thought.   Analysis of the Structure:   Its a bit challenging for myself to believe that wave x will end this early, but for now based on the structure that I can see, I believe wave x is ending on Monday or Tuesday at 229.07 or 236.40.   Analysis of the Cycles:   We have started the second 80D cycle of the current 20W cycle. This 80D cycle has to be less bullish than the previous one since the 20W cycle is now pushing to the downside.   Some important dates to remember:   1. 20D cycle trough on 15th or 16th of November.   2. 40D cycle trough on 1-4th of December.   3. 20W cycle trough in the last week of December 2023.",

(BRK.A, BRK.B) reported its third-quarter earnings Saturday, which showed a net loss of $12.77 billion but the company's operating income rose by 40.65% from the year-ago period to $10.76 billion.   Yields Boost Cash Hoard   Berkshire continued to expand its huge cash hoard to a record $157.2 billion, up from $147.4 billion in the second quarter.   The cash pile is largely invested in U.S. Treasury bills, which recently surged to 5%. The company increased its Treasury bill holdings by 36% in the last year, which totaled $126 billion in the third quarter.   Berkshire is likely looking to capitalize on the yields that exceed consumer inflation by more than 1 percentage point as rising interest rates have made investments in Treasuries more attractive.   Price Momentum   BRK.A is trading near the top of its 52-week range and above its 200-day simple moving average.   What does this mean?   Investors have been pushing the share price higher, and the stock still appears to have upward momentum. This is a positive sign for the stock's future value.",

        "text": "KEY POINTS   a. Netflix now has 15 million subscribers in its ad-supported tier.   b. The company is also rolling out new ad products.   c. The success of the new subscription tier is just one of the reasons the stock has surged this year.   The leading streamer just hit a key milestone with its ad business.   Netflix (NFLX 1.80%) was one of the best-performing stocks of the 2010s, but for much of the current decade, the once-meteoric growth stock has struggled to achieve liftoff.   The company got a temporary boost from the pandemic, only to give it all back and then some when the economy reopened in 2022, and it lost subscribers two quarters in a row. Since then, the streaming leader has regrouped, launching initiatives that some investors had long asked for, such as adding an ad-supported tier and cracking down on password sharing.   The results of those moves have been overwhelmingly successful with the stock up 47% year to date, even as many of its streaming peers like Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery are trading near 52-week lows.   With the help of paid sharing, Netflix has added nearly 15 million new subscribers over the last two quarters, beating its total additions from the previous five quarters. The stock jumped following the third-quarter earnings report in October on strong subscriber growth as well.   Building on this recent momentum, Netflix provided an update Wednesday that shows its new ad-based strategy is paying off.   A key milestone   It's been one year since the company launched its ad-supported tier in a handful of its biggest markets, and the company said the new service has now signed up 15 million subscribers, up from just 5 million in May. That news should not only tamp down concerns that growth from this tier has been weaker than expected but also show that the ad-supported option is clearly resonating with subscribers. Additionally, it's impressive to see those gains coming at a time when much of the digital advertising industry is struggling.   That figure represents more than half of net subscriber additions over the last year, though some of the ad-tier subscribers likely traded down from the more expensive ad-free tiers, especially after Netflix just raised prices on some of its plans in the U.S., U.K., and France.   Netflix has also refined its advertising product since launch and now offers five different ad lengths, ranging from 10 seconds to 60 seconds. It also offers targeting to mobile devices as well as options like more genres, time of day, and new audience demographics. Downloads are expected to be available by the end of the week, making Netflix the only ad-supported streamer to offer downloads.   The company has more new features planned for next year, including a binge-watching bonus that gives ad-tier subscribers an ad-free episode after they've watched three episodes in a row. It will also begin offering QR codes in ads and is expanding its partnerships program globally, allowing advertisers to sponsor certain shows.   Netflix's ad-supported tier may cannibalize some ad-free subscribers, but that's part of the company's strategy. Offering ads gives it cover to raise prices on ad-free tiers, as it just did, allowing the company to make more money from the ad-free side of the business (with the idea that the ad-supported tier should be revenue-neutral compared to the ad-free subscription, as it has been for Hulu).   The ad-tier option also capitalizes on massive existing demand from advertisers. As former CEO Reed Hastings noted in an Oct. 2022 earnings call, advertisers have been left behind by the transition to streaming and are anxious to follow the eyeballs that have already gravitated over to streaming services.   With more than 200 million subscribers globally, intimate knowledge of their viewing habits, and the ability to perform precise targeting, Netflix can offer advertisers much more than a traditional linear TV platform.   Why it's a buy   A little more than a year ago, investors seemed to think the growth story at Netflix was over. However, the recent rebound and strength from paid sharing and advertising shows the streamer's second act is well underway.   The company forecast subscriber additions of around 9 million in the current quarter, showing the recent momentum should continue, and its subscription business model means that incremental revenue flows through to the bottom line. Indeed, management sees operating margin improving from 20% this year to 22% to 23% in 2024.   If Netflix can continue to deliver subscriber growth, there's room for profits to go significantly higher. The success of the ad-supported tier will only make that easier.",

It is also quite possible that this could be the beginning of a longer cycle 3rd wave on the weekly time frame.   The technical risks that I see here are the bearish price to RSI divergence (dotted trend lines) that is emerging on the 1 week time frame. This comes on the heels of the recent rally in price that came directly after a bullish price to RSI divergence (solid bottom trend lines) and provides me an element of technical confliction in the analysis that warrants caution. As a result, Im cautiously bullish here with a minimum price target of 7.46 and a secondary target of 9.12 before the end of the year.   Not financial Advice. All stocks can go to zero.",

With some earnings analysts/companies revising upwards on earnings for Q4, as well as massive stock buy backs, and the issuance of new Treasury Bills (Debt) near 1 trillion dollars as well, we've found our fuel for this rally.

Structure  says by the end of November  we will see low that is lower than the October's close.   Below I'll explain.   Let's start with the Oversold indicators. The biggest signal I see that the market should bounce starting mid week Is that most sectors,indexes, and stocks are outside their weekly Bollinger band.   Typically  when that happens, the following  weeks candle rallies back inside the bollingerband and sometimes close above the previous candle; for spy this would mean a move back up to 425.   Also the 4hour MFI  on spy is still oversold at 2% rebound levels.   This is just a weekly bounce so the rally could fade in a couple of weeks.   Now let's look at Structure.   Biggest red flag is the 3 black crows on the monthly charts of the indexes and most sectors since August hang man reversal candle.   Please Google 3 black crows candle pattern.   This candle stick pattern when formed after a major rally usually  indicates a 4th red candle and a lower low is incoming.   This means that since the weekly is oversold, We could rally to mid Nov but by December  first we will be back to October's  lows and probably  lower..   That's why my target is 425 first on spy then 390 by December.   Whenever my technicals  tell me of such a dramatic  move, I start going through the economic  calender looking for events. The biggest event  after the interest rate hike is the Government  funding which is slated for mid Nov; If the politicians can't get their stuff together this could be the match for the flush.   NYA  weekly chart   Biggest indicator that this correction isn't over is the rising wedge that's been unfolding.  If you want to know where every other stocks outside tech is going you to need chart NYA.   The  length  of a rising wedge  is the measured move  of the pattern.   With that being said, we still have 10% drop left to go. To put that in perspective, we've  corrected 10% already from this year's high, so get ready for an encore.   This most likely means  Spy  below 390 at some point in 2024.   NYA   Daily chart   H&S playing out here, broke the neckline Friday. Similar H&S on the dow too which means we probably could see 404-408 on spy before the rally  begins   Dow jones Daily chart   Blue lines are my H&S target.   The first blue line is at  32,246 gap close . If the dow bounces off here then that means spy 408 only.   2nd blue line is  the H&S completion.   31,744.. this means spy 404.   If you notice on both NYA and Dow, they are both nearing support on their downtrend  so I do expect a bounce this week.   IWM = Terrible   Approaching  lower bband on monthly chart.   Weekly chart is more oversold here than in 2022.   Structure  is terrible  here, we are halfway  through closing gap at 160..   If we break  160,  then 155 gap close is next.   Smaller time frame the price is showing a  falling wedge that could push this back to 171 if 160 holds   XLK sector (Msft/Aapl)   Weekly chart   Nearing support of yellow channel. I expect a bounce and rally this week off trendline support.   Notice  the narrowing of the yellow channel which means these rallies and flushes will become volatile as space narrows. This is the biggest sector , so  If we reject at trendline resistance  again  390 on spy is definitely  incoming.   150 is my target for XLK correction   SMH  weekly chart   (Nvda/Amd)   You can't see the major gap at  136 on the weekly but I placed a line there so you can see the price action.  136 support aligns with yellow trendline here so as long as that holds I think chips will rally here back to resistance  but on the next leg down we will head to 123 and chips will take a major hair cut. Monthly  chart 3 black crows.   XLC   Googl,Meta,Nflx   Structure  is terrible..   Monthly  3 black crows   Weekly selling volume .   If tech dips this week, I the stocks in this sector to lead the way. If market rallies then I expect a small participation  but I'd stay away from anything in this sector as far a dip buy goes   Vix   Rising wedge   Or   Inverted  H&S   What If said  both ?   As long as we don't break 16 the Inverted  H&S is still a play. The drop to 16 on vix would pump the spy to 425-430   Spy monthly   Broadening  channel here.   Went parabolic  in 2020 and broke out. Retested  breakout back in 2022.  I think we retest  that channel again.   Fib levels are from 2009 low and All time high.   Spy weekly chart.   Like I said , I'm looking for 390 test by early December  then a End of year rally.   Spy daily chart   I've circled the last 2 bounces to show you how a double bottom was formed  before a rally started .  Which means expect volatility  early next week into Wed.  Finished outside Daily bollingerbands  which means Monday they most likely buy up any  gap down  with upside targets   412, 414.   I'll go over smaller time frames on spy  tomorrow  premarket for day trading purposes.",

The MACD indicator also shows a bearish divergence, meaning that the price is making higher highs while the momentum is making lower highs. This signals a potential reversal in the near future.

        "text": "Hi   ,   Well, first of all, it's important to note that I have an open position in this dividend-paying stock because I want to hold it for the long term.   However, we should not ignore the fact that we will start wave C of a possible ABC correction soon. We can also see a bear flag shape. Both have a price target of ~$14 to $15.   Regarding the fundamentals, some important things:   Traditional tobacco companies have to face the fact that their products are becoming more and more expensive, thus many people buy cheaper products.   Vapor and liquid alternatives are increasingly popular among the younger generation. Because they are fragrant, tasty and cheaper.   Although these companies have made a lot of profit in the past decades, they are now facing another challenge. If they want to stay competitive, they have to develop to catch up with their competitors who produce products based on new technologies.   Altria Group is constantly working to achieve this. However, the transformation of the production technology and the necessary permits (e.g. FDA) are essential for its success. It's all money and time.   All in all, I think that stocks of traditional tobacco companies are still a good long-term investment. However, it should be taken into account that they may underperform in the coming months. And they can hit new lows.   That's why I didn't use all my resources that I intended for this stock. Because if we actually reach the ~$15 zone, then I want to significantly increase my position size there.   Please tell me what you think about it. And share your thoughts.   Do not forget.

The fact that side effects have developed worldwide due to the Covid vaccine and many people have filed lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies probably also plays a role in this deep decline.   There is a lot of money in the pharmaceutical industry, so I think that the companies will have plenty of money to cover possible legal costs. And since in several countries they have signed papers that they request the vaccination on their own responsibility, the exclusion of liability will be justified in many cases.   The $30 zone seems like a perfect turning point because I see it as a strong level. If the $30 zone holds, we will most likely look at the $40 zone, which also coincides with an important Fibonacci level.   Do not forget. This does not constitute investment advice.

VOLATILTIY.   I use the VXX ETN for the metrics it provides, albeit its idiosyncrasies.   August into September, a breakdown into a lower range indicated that a RISK-ON situation was in the equity markets. Since September, this started reversing, rather strongly, and consolidated at the earlier range.   In the past week, Thursday, it gave an real indication of what is forming... a significant Volatility breakout. This first stage break out is seen with the breaking out of a trend line, formed by the 4/1 line of the Gann Fan. This movement is a rather solid candlestick with momentum to boot, and both MACD and VolDiv are crossing up bullishly and breaking into the next upper range.   So, expect a break out of the upper range (orange rectangle), as well as the 8/1 line of the Gann Fan forming the next trend line resistance. When this happens, VXX may be spring boarding to 35, from 26-27 area. That is like a 50% increase in VXX.   Keep a close eye on this... the more the signs point, the more real it becomes.",

It pulled back to its   liquidity zone   between $370-385 from which it has made a new impulse.   Final target: new all-time highs   .   1 M   On a long term chart we note that   NFLX   in July 2022   rested on its bullish trendline to develop a new bullish leg   . Its final target for the next few years would be around $2,000.   1 W   In the shorter term on a weekly chart we observe that   NFLX   is developing a   symmetrical triangle that is highly likely to break to the upside   . The minimum target for such a breakout would take it to   around $580   . It should be remembered that the first obstacle after that breakout will be the   61.8% Fibonacci   ($492) so it is likely to make a   pull-back   to the breakout line. In addition, the   bearish gap   from the end of July will be a resistance to be taken into account.   The 470-495$ is a great liquidity zone   that will allow it to perform a new bullish wave with a   first target   at 580$ (target of the broken triangle) and a   second target   at new all-time highs.   1 D   The company's third quarter results have led to a large bullish gap with a large volume   (the second largest of the year), this translates a   great strength   as demonstrated by the verticality of the rise. It is logical that in the coming days there could be a correction as prices hit the   medium-term downtrend line   .

Unlike before where rejection at resistance brought us to lower lows, we should theoretically form a higher low when we pull back from this rally.   This week was of extreme greed and a short squeezy nature, we had back-to-back gap ups which is incredibly bullish, but can create an opportunity for a pullback.   I think bears have a good shot at shorting here and I would like to see the resistance zone push us back down to the 422-420  area,  from here I think we can form the inverse head and shoulders and ride out the year to the 450s or 460s.   2024 may be a different story, as yield un-inversion can telegraph a recession, but we aren't there yet, for now expect dips to be met with buy demand,   it is likely that interest rates are not going to be raised again and the market knows it.",

The former ideas lead to 5 positions which resulted in (+94.21%, +90.81%, +63.10%, +41.22% and +28.84%).   If you want to check them out here are the links:   ( +90.81%)   (4 postions | +28.84%, +41,22%, +63.10%, +94.21%)   As the next report for earnings and revenue is tomorrow i expect some volatility kicking in. If take a look at past days they always caused some volatility. It is to note however that the kind of reports (positive or negative earnings) never gave a hint in which direction it would go only that some volatility was coming in.   Next thing to mention is the weakness of price, as it failed moving to the 50% of the Fib. See the red circle. A big sell- out followed that weakness.   There are currently 2 scenarios which im looking for.   Scenario 1 (Orange arrow)   Requirements:   Price falling below S/R Level 2 and S/R Level 4 but retaking them after.

        "text": "In the first part, we discussed the components of the price action theory. We covered value area, control line, and excess price with examples, setups & guidelines (with my own observations.) Now, in this idea, we are going to cover the following topics:   No trading zone   Initiative & responsive trading   Shifting of the value area   Bullish Value area   Bearish value area   Extention of the value area   Combining all the pieces   I request all of you to visit our first part if you have not read it yet.   Check out the following demo chart, and try to mention each component by yourself:   Now, you can check the following chart, and see if you have denoted correctly or noted:   1) No trading zone:   No trading zone/activities is the area where trading is not happening. It shows the strength of buyers in the lower band and the strength of the sellers in the upper boundary. Its shows who is controlling, who will be controlling, and who have lost the opportunity.   What does it mean?   If the length of the no-trading zone is wide at the lower band, it shows that buyers are controlling the movement and sellers are not able to form trading activities.   If the length of the no-trading zone is wide at the upper band, it shows that sellers are controlling the movement and buyers are not able to form trading activities.   Observing the given formation that shows a sideways value area is enough to understand the whole story. There were actually three no-trading zones in the value area: two on the lower band and one on the upper band.   The first NTZ(No-trading zone) on the lower band was the signal of the movement controlled by buyers. NTZ-2 was the widest of the value area, where sellers snatched the control from buyers and started outnumbering the buyers.  NTZ-3 was the last no-trading zone where the buyers were on the controlled buy and couldn't give a response to the sellers' initiative move. The excess was the last price point from sellers that started the supply pressure.   2) Initiative & responsive trading   As we discussed earlier, price movements are the result of the interaction between supply and demand. Buyer(demand) and seller's(supply) intuition are the main components of the price.   Value area from where buyers and sellers are satisfied with the current prices. Neither buyers want to increase, nor the seller is interested in low prices at least for some duration. It's called equilibrium between buyers and sellers.   What if it's enough?   # Now buyers don't want to keep the prices as it's too low for them. So, the buyers will make an initiative to break the upper band of the value area. It is called \"initiative\" by buyers.   # Sellers have to stop them from going out of the value area by making excess, which is called \"response\" by sellers. Anyone, either buyers or sellers, who are not satisfied can make an initiative. However, the opposite party has to respond to their initiative and settle into equilibrium again.   Case 1:   - The movement can only reach equilibrium by responding to each initiative. If a failure occurs, it signals evidence of a big move in the direction of the initiative. As per the chart, whenever buyers have made an initiative to move outside of the value area, sellers have responded with supply pressure and vice versa.   Case 2:   - Buyers have made an initiative, but sellers couldn't hold back the buyers' pressure and ended up losing movement. Here, we can say that the buyers have given a breakout of the value area, and the sellers' response was a failure.   3) Shifting of the value area   - Traders don't have to be upset after the breakout of the value area. Supply and demand will balance and unbalance again, and traders will get an opportunity to trade according to the theory. We all know of the tenet of the dow theory that   \"price tends to trend   .\" Value area also shifts its value after the breakout/breakdown, often in the direction of the trend.   Uptrend:   The price was in an uptrend. After the breakout of the first value area, it has formed the second, and so on.   Downtrend:   The price was in a downtrend. After the breakdown of the first value area, it has formed the second, and so on.",

        "text": "Hello Trader   Today we have to talk about financial knowledge, how important is it to have financial knowledge and whether can it make us financially free.   Let's begin,   Everyone needs money to survive. Financial planning is the process of managing your money wisely to achieve your financial goals. It involves planning your future finances keeping in mind your current situation.   In simple terms, financial planning helps you answer questions like:   How can I save more money?   When can I comfortably retire?   How can I pay my debts?   All these questions are very important if you want to be financially free   *   Financial planning helps you identify your long-term and short-term goals, whether it's buying a house, children's education, or retirement so that you don't have to worry about anything.   *   An important aspect of financial planning is insurance. It helps protect you and your loved ones from unexpected events like accidents, illnesses, or the loss of a loved one. By getting the right insurance coverage, you can minimize the financial disaster of such situations.   *   Investments are also a part of financial planning. It involves putting your money into different types of assets, such as stocks, bonds, or real estate, to grow your wealth over time. Financial planning also involves knowing where to allocate your investments accurately.   Finally, financial planning includes preparing for retirement. It involves estimating how much money you will need in retirement and determining how much you should save each month to reach that goal. Retirement planning ensures that you can enjoy a comfortable and financially secure life after you stop working.   Types of financial planning   1) Tax Planning   Tax planning is the process of arranging your finances in a smart way to pay the least amount of taxes while staying within the rules set by the government. It involves making decisions about when to receive income, how to spend money, and which deductions or credits to take advantage of. The goal is to legally reduce the amount of taxes you have to pay, so you can keep more of your hard-earned money.   Types of Tax planning   Tax planning is a way to reduce the amount of tax you have to pay. But it's not just about that - it also tells you how to make smart decisions with your money to reach your financial goals. By investing in the right things at the right time, you can increase not only the tax but also your wealth. So tax planning is not just about minimizing taxes, it's about making your money work for you.   Following are the various methods of tax planning   (A) Short-term tax planning   In short-term tax planning, individuals or businesses focus on finding legal ways to reduce their tax liability as the end of the fiscal year approaches. It does not require long-term commitments but can still result in significant tax savings.   (B) Long-term tax planning   With long-term tax planning, individuals or businesses create a tax plan at the beginning of the fiscal year and follow it throughout the year. While immediate tax benefits may not be available, this approach can be beneficial in the long run.   (C) Permissive tax planning   Permissive tax planning involves utilizing various provisions within the tax laws of a country, such as deductions, exemptions, contributions, and incentives. For example, in India, there are provisions like Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961, which offer deductions on specific tax-saving investments.   (D) Purposive tax planning   Purposive tax planning involves using tax-saving instruments with a specific purpose in mind. This strategy ensures that you maximize the benefits of your investments. It includes carefully selecting suitable investments, having a plan for replacing assets if necessary, and diversifying business and income assets based on your residency status.   2) insurance planning   If you don't plan properly for insurance, unexpected events in life can leave you financially vulnerable. By insurance planning, you can identify the risks that may affect your life and choose the right insurance policy to protect against those risks. So that you can protect yourself and your family financially in the future.   Let's talk about the benefits of insurance planning   (A) Protection from Unexpected Events   Having a good insurance policy helps you reduce the financial risks associated with things like illness, accidents, or even death. It ensures that you and your family are prepared to face these unexpected challenges without having to give up your quality of life.   (B) Different Types of Insurance Coverage   *   There are different types of insurance policies that cover various risks. For example, health insurance plans cover medical emergencies, hospital expenses, medications, and doctor visits.   *   Life insurance or personal accident insurance provides coverage in case of premature death.   *   Motor insurance protects your vehicles against theft, accidents, and liabilities to third parties.   *   Travel insurance policies offer coverage for unexpected events during your trips. By choosing the right combination of policies, you can create a complete financial protection plan for yourself and your family.   (C) Financial Protection   Insurance planning provides financial security by compensating for losses incurred during covered emergencies. It helps you recover financially from unexpected situations and protects your savings.   (D) Tax Benefits   Certain insurance plans also provide tax savings. For example, the premiums you pay for health insurance are eligible for tax deductions under the Income Tax Act. This means you can lower your taxable income by purchasing specific insurance policies.   (E) Peace of Mind   Having a well-planned insurance portfolio gives you peace of mind. You don't have to worry about losing your savings due to unforeseen events. You can also plan for the financial well-being of your family even after your death by using term and life insurance plans.   Insurance planning can be easier if these points are kept in mind   3) Investment planning   *   Investment planning is a process that helps you make smart decisions about your money.   *   It involves thinking about your goals and figuring out the best ways to use your money to achieve those goals.   *   There are various options for investment, such as putting your money in stocks, bonds, or property and earning good profits.   *   This planning helps you build a strong financial foundation and make adjustments as needed.   Here I will tell about 7 benefits of investment planning   (A) Building Wealth   Investment plans with life insurance are a reliable way to grow your wealth over time. As an investor, you can choose the plan that best suits your needs based on risk, returns, and the amount you can invest. These plans can provide financial assistance for future expenses like your child's education, their wedding, your retirement, or a pension.   (B) Financial Security   Life insurance policies offer both life coverage and investment options. They take care of your family financially by providing both survival benefits and death benefits. When the policy matures, you receive returns with profits. This ensures long-term financial security for your family. In the unfortunate event of your demise before the maturity period, the insurance company pays the sum assured to your nominee, providing financial protection to your family.   (C) Coverage for Death Risk   Not all investment options offer coverage for the risk of death, but investment plans with life insurance do. These plans include death risk coverage, ensuring that your family's financial needs are taken care of even in your absence. The sum assured is paid to the nominee in the event of your death.   (D)Retirement Savings   You can purchase these investment plans at any stage of life, allowing you to create a retirement corpus. By investing in these plans, you can become financially independent even after retirement.   (E) Flexibility   These investment plans offer flexibility in terms of the amount you can invest and the duration. You can choose what suits your needs and financial planning.   (E) Tax Savings   Investment plans not only provide risk cover and help accumulate wealth, but they also offer tax savings. The premiums and payouts are exempted from tax under sections 80C and 10(10D) of the Indian Tax Act. These plans offer a perfect combination of savings, wealth creation, financial protection, and tax benefits.   (F) Loan Facility   Life insurance investment plans can also act as loan facilitators, depending on the coverage you have, the premiums paid, and your eligibility for the loan amount.   4)  Retirement planning   *   Retirement planning is the process of preparing for life after you stop working.   *   It involves thinking about how much money you will need to live comfortably when you are not earning a regular income.   *   Retirement planning tells you how to save and invest your money wisely to have enough funds to support yourself during your retirement years.   *   Retirement planning is essential so that you can enjoy a comfortable and worry-free life when you decide to stop working.   Understanding retirement planning   *   Retirement planning is the act of preparing for life after employment, which includes not only financial aspects but all areas of one's life.   *   Beyond financial considerations, retirement planning includes lifestyle choices, such as how to spend time, where to live, and when to stop working altogether.   *   Retirement planning focuses on different stages of life.   *   In the early stages of a career, the emphasis is on setting aside sufficient funds for retirement.   *   As one approaches mid-career, it may also include establishing specific income or wealth goals and taking the necessary steps to achieve them.   *   Thus, retirement planning is necessary for you to lead a comfortable life at the time of retirement.   5) Estate planning   *   Estate planning is when you make important decisions about what happens to your money, assets, and liabilities after you pass away or if you become unable to make decisions for yourself.   *   This includes things like choosing who will receive your assets, making sure debts and taxes are taken care of, and even deciding who will take care of your children or pets.   *   People usually work with an attorney who knows estate law to help them plan.   *   Some common steps in estate planning include making an inventory of what you own and owe and checking your bank account.   Process of Estate Planning   *   Estate planning is the process of deciding what will happen to a person's assets after they pass away and how their financial affairs will be managed if they become unable to do so themselves. It's important to know that estate planning is not only for wealthy individuals; anyone can and should consider it.   *   An estate includes things like houses, cars, investments, artwork, life insurance, pensions, and debts. People have different reasons for estate planning, such as preserving family wealth, providing for their spouse and children, funding education for future generations, or leaving a charitable legacy.   *   The first step in estate planning is usually creating a will.   Other important tasks include   *   Setting up trust accounts to reduce estate taxes and benefit specific beneficiaries.   *   Designating a guardian for dependents who are still alive.   *   Choosing an executor to oversee the will's instructions.   *   Updating beneficiaries on life insurance policies, IRAs, and 401(k) accounts.   *   Making funeral arrangements in advance.   *   Making annual gifts to charities or nonprofits to lower the taxable estate.   *   Creating a durable power of attorney to handle other assets and investments.   By taking these steps, individuals can ensure that their wishes are followed, their loved ones are provided for, and their assets are distributed as intended.   6) Cash flow planning   *   Cash flow planning is all about managing and predicting how money comes into and goes out of someone's or a business's finances. It means keeping track of how much money is earned (income) and how much is spent (expenses) during a specific time, usually every month or year.   *   The main goal of cash flow planning is to make sure there's enough money to cover important expenses, meet financial commitments, and achieve money-related objectives. It helps individuals and businesses make smart choices when it comes to spending, saving, and investing their money.   *   Basically, cash flow planning involves creating a budget or financial plan that outlines the expected sources of income and estimates of expenses. By analyzing and keeping an eye on cash flow, it becomes possible to spot potential shortages or surpluses and adjust accordingly.

Stop-loss orders, position sizing algorithms, and risk management rules can be integrated to protect against adverse market movements or unexpected news outcomes. This helps to minimize losses and ensure controlled risk exposure.   Flash Crash 2010: A Historic Market Event   On May 6, 2010, the financial markets experienced an unprecedented event known as the \"Flash Crash.\" Within a matter of minutes, stock prices plummeted dramatically, only to recover shortly thereafter. This sudden and extreme market turbulence sent shockwaves through the financial world and highlighted the vulnerabilities of an increasingly interconnected and technology-driven trading landscape.   The Flash Crash Unfolds:   On that fateful day, between 2:32 p.m. and 2:45 p.m. EDT, the U.S. stock market experienced an abrupt and severe decline in prices. Within minutes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged nearly 1,000 points, erasing approximately $1 trillion in market value. Blue-chip stocks, such as Procter & Gamble and Accenture, saw their prices briefly crash to a mere fraction of their pre-crash values. This sudden and dramatic collapse was followed by a swift rebound, with prices largely recovering by the end of the trading session.   The Contributing Factors:   Several factors converged to create the perfect storm for the Flash Crash. One key element was the increasing prevalence of high-frequency trading (HFT), where computer algorithms execute trades at lightning-fast speeds. This automated trading, combined with the interconnectedness of markets, exacerbated the speed and intensity of the crash. Additionally, the widespread use of stop-loss orders, which are triggered when a stock reaches a specified price, amplified the selling pressure as prices rapidly declined. A lack of adequate market safeguards and regulatory mechanisms further exacerbated the situation.   Role of Algorithmic Trading:   Algorithmic trading played a significant role in the Flash Crash. As the markets rapidly declined, certain algorithmic trading strategies failed to function as intended, exacerbating the sell-off. These algorithms, designed to capture small price discrepancies, ended up engaging in a \"feedback loop\" of selling, pushing prices even lower. The speed and automation of algorithmic trading made it difficult for human intervention to effectively mitigate the situation in real-time.   Market Reforms and Lessons Learned:   The Flash Crash of 2010 prompted significant regulatory and technological reforms aimed at preventing similar events in the future. Measures included the implementation of circuit breakers, which temporarily halt trading during extreme price movements, and revisions to market-wide circuit breaker rules. Market surveillance and coordination between exchanges and regulators were also enhanced to better monitor and respond to unusual trading activity. Additionally, the incident highlighted the need for greater transparency and scrutiny of algorithmic trading practices.   Implications for Market Stability:   The Flash Crash served as a wake-up call to market participants and regulators, underscoring the potential risks associated with high-frequency and algorithmic trading. It highlighted the importance of ensuring that market infrastructure and regulations keep pace with technological advancements. The incident also emphasized the need for market participants to understand the intricacies of the trading systems they employ, and for regulators to continually evaluate and adapt regulatory frameworks to address emerging risks.   The Flash Crash of 2010 stands as a pivotal moment in financial market history, exposing vulnerabilities in the increasingly complex and interconnected world of electronic trading. The event triggered significant reforms and led to a greater focus on market stability, transparency, and risk management. While strides have been made to enhance market safeguards and regulatory oversight, ongoing vigilance and continuous adaptation to technological advancements are necessary to maintain the integrity and stability of modern financial markets.   How Algorithmic Trading Thrives in Changing Markets?   Algorithmic trading (ALGO) can tackle changing market conditions through various techniques and strategies that allow algorithms to adapt and respond effectively. Here are some ways ALGO can address changing market conditions:   Real-Time Data Analysis: Algo systems continuously monitor market data, including price movements, volume, news feeds, and economic indicators, in real-time. By analyzing this data promptly, algorithms can identify changing market conditions and adjust trading strategies accordingly. This enables Algo to capture opportunities and react to market shifts more rapidly than human traders.   Dynamic Order Routing: Algo systems can dynamically route orders to different exchanges or liquidity pools based on prevailing market conditions. By assessing factors such as liquidity, order book depth, and execution costs, algorithms can adapt their order routing strategies to optimize trade execution. This flexibility ensures that algo takes advantage of the most favorable market conditions available at any given moment.   Adaptive Trading Strategies: Algo can utilize adaptive trading strategies that are designed to adjust their parameters or rules based on changing market conditions. These strategies often incorporate machine learning algorithms to continuously learn from historical data and adapt to evolving market dynamics. By dynamically modifying their rules and parameters, algo systems can optimize trading decisions and capture opportunities across different market environments.   Volatility Management: Changing market conditions often come with increased volatility. Algo systems can incorporate volatility management techniques to adjust risk exposure accordingly. For example, algorithms may dynamically adjust position sizes, set tighter stop-loss levels, or modify risk management parameters based on current market volatility. These measures help to control risk and protect capital during periods of heightened uncertainty.   Pattern Recognition and Statistical Analysis: Algo systems can employ advanced pattern recognition and statistical analysis techniques to identify recurring market patterns or anomalies. By recognizing these patterns, algorithms can make informed trading decisions and adjust strategies accordingly. This ability to identify and adapt to patterns helps algocapitalize on recurring market conditions while also remaining adaptable to changes in market behavior.   Backtesting and Simulation: Algo systems can be extensively backtested and simulated using historical market data. By subjecting algorithms to various market scenarios and historical data sets, traders can evaluate their performance and robustness under different market conditions. This process allows for fine-tuning and optimization of algo strategies to better handle changing market dynamics.   In summary, algo tackles changing market conditions through real-time data analysis, dynamic order routing, adaptive trading strategies, volatility management, pattern recognition, statistical analysis, and rigorous backtesting. By leveraging these capabilities, algo can effectively adapt to evolving market conditions and capitalize on opportunities while managing risks more efficiently than traditional trading approaches   The Rise of Algo Traders: Is Technical Analysis Losing Ground?   Although algorithmic trading (algo trading) can automate and optimize certain elements   of technical analysis, it is improbable that it will fully substitute it. Technical analysis is a financial discipline that encompasses the examination of historical price and volume data, chart patterns, indicators, and other market variables to inform trading strategies. There are several reasons why algo traders cannot entirely supplant technical analysis:   Interpretation of Market Psychology: Technical analysis incorporates the understanding of market psychology, which is based on the belief that historical price patterns repeat themselves due to human behavior. It involves analyzing investor sentiment, trends, support and resistance levels, and other factors that can influence market movements. Algo traders may use technical indicators to identify these patterns, but they may not fully capture the nuances of market sentiment and psychological factors.   Subjectivity in Analysis: Technical analysis often involves subjective interpretation by traders, as different individuals may analyze the same chart or indicator differently. Algo traders rely on predefined rules and algorithms that may not encompass all the subjective elements of technical analysis. Human traders can incorporate their experience, intuition, and judgment to make nuanced decisions that may not be easily captured by algorithms.   Market Adaptability: Technical analysis requires the ability to adapt to changing market conditions and adjust strategies accordingly. While algorithms can be programmed to adjust certain parameters based on market data, they may not possess the same adaptability as human traders who can dynamically interpret and respond to evolving market conditions in real-time.   Unpredictable Events: Technical analysis is often challenged by unexpected events, such as geopolitical developments, economic announcements, or corporate news, which can cause significant market disruptions. Human traders may have the ability to interpret and react to these events based on their knowledge and understanding, while algo traders may struggle to respond effectively to unforeseen circumstances.   Fundamental Analysis: Technical analysis primarily focuses on price and volume data, while fundamental analysis considers broader factors such as company financials, macroeconomic indicators, industry trends, and news events. Algo traders may not have the capacity to analyze fundamental factors and incorporate them into their decision-making process, which can limit their ability to fully replace technical analysis.   In conclusion, while algo trading can automate certain elements of technical analysis, it is unlikely to replace it entirely. Technical analysis incorporates subjective interpretation, market psychology, adaptability, and fundamental factors that may be challenging for algorithms to fully replicate. Human traders with expertise in technical analysis and the ability to interpret market dynamics will continue to play a significant role in making informed trading decisions.   The Ultimate Winner - Algo Trading or Manual Trading?   Determining whether algo trading or manual trading is best depends on various factors, including individual preferences, trading goals, and skill sets. Both approaches have their advantages and limitations, and what works best for one person may not be the same for another. Let's compare the two:   Speed and Efficiency: Algo trading excels in speed and efficiency, as computer algorithms can analyze data and execute trades within milliseconds. Manual trading involves human decision-making, which may be subject to cognitive biases and emotional factors, potentially leading to slower execution or missed opportunities.   Emotion and Discipline: Algo trading eliminates emotional biases from trading decisions, as algorithms follow predefined rules without being influenced by fear or greed. Manual trading requires discipline and emotional control to make objective decisions, which can be challenging for some traders.   Adaptability: Algo trading can quickly adapt to changing market conditions and execute trades based on pre-programmed rules. Manual traders can adapt their strategies as well, but it may require more time and effort to monitor and adjust to rapidly evolving market dynamics.   Complexity and Technical Knowledge: Algo trading requires programming skills or the use of algorithmic platforms, which can be challenging for traders without a technical background. Manual trading, on the other hand, relies on an understanding of fundamental and technical analysis, which requires continuous learning and analysis of market trends.   Strategy Development: Algo trading allows for systematic and precise strategy development based on historical data analysis and backtesting. Manual traders can develop their strategies as well, but it may involve more subjective interpretations of charts, patterns, and indicators.   Risk Management: Both algo trading and manual trading require effective risk management. Algo trading can incorporate predetermined risk management parameters into algorithms, whereas manual traders need to actively monitor and manage risk based on their judgment.   Ultimately, the best approach depends on individual circumstances. Some traders may prefer algo trading for its speed, efficiency, and objective decision-making, while others may enjoy the flexibility and adaptability of manual trading. It is worth noting that many traders use a combination of both approaches, utilizing algo trading for certain strategies and manual trading for others.   In conclusion, algorithmic trading offers benefits such as speed, efficiency, and risk management, while manual trading provides adaptability and human intuition. AI enhances algorithmic trading by processing data, recognizing patterns, and providing decision support. Algos excel in automated news monitoring and event-driven strategies. However, the Flash Crash of 2010 exposed vulnerabilities in the interconnected trading landscape, with algorithmic trading exacerbating the market decline. It serves as a reminder to implement appropriate safeguards and risk management measures. Overall, a balanced approach that combines the strengths of both algorithmic and manual trading can lead to more effective and resilient trading strategies.",

        "text": "The business cycle describes how the economy expands and contracts over time. It is an upward and downward movement of the gross domestic product along with its long-term growth rate.   The business cycle consists o   f 6 phases/stages   :   1. Expansion   2. Peak   3. Recession   4. Depression   5. Trough   6. Recovery   1) Expansion   :   Sectors Affected:   Technology, Consumer discretion   Expansion is the first stage of the business cycle. The economy moves slowly upward, and the cycle begins.   The government strengthens the economy:   Lowering taxes   Boost in spending.   - When the growth slows, the central bank reduces rates to encourage businesses to borrow.   - As the economy expands, economic indicators are likely to show positive signals, such as employment, income, wages, profits, demand, and supply.   - A rise in employment increases consumer confidence increasing activity in the housing markets, and growth turns positive. A high level of demand and insufficient supply lead to an increase in the price of production. Investors take a loan with high rates to fill the demand pressure. This process continues until the economy becomes favorable for expansion.   2) Peak   :   Sector Affected   : Financial, energy, materials   - The second stage of the business cycle is the peak which shows the maximum growth of the economy. Identifying the end point of an expansion is the most complex task because it can last for serval years.   - This phase shows a reduction in unemployment rates. The market continues its positive outlook. During expansion, the central bank looks for signs of building price pressures, and increased rates can contribute to this peak. The central bank also tries to protect the economy against inflation in this stage.   - Since employment rates, income, wages, profits, demand & supply are already high, there is no further increase.   - The investor will produce more and more to fill the demand pressure. Thus, the investment and product will become expensive. At this time point, the investor will not get a return due to inflation. Prices are way higher for buyers to buy. From this situation, a recession takes place. The economy reverses from this stage.   3) Recession   :   Sector Affected   : Utilities, healthcare, consumer staples   - Two consecutive quarters of back-to-back declines in gross domestic product constitute a recession.   - The recession is followed by a peak phase. In this phase economic indicators start melting down. The demand for the goods decreased due to expensive prices. Supply will keep increasing, and on the other hand, demand will begin to decline. That causes an \"excess of supply\" and will lead to falling in prices.   4) Depression   :   - In more prolonged downturns, the economy enters into a depression phase. The period of malaise is called depression. Depression doesn't happen often, but when they do, there seems to be no amount of policy stimulus that can lift consumers and businesses out of their slumps. When The economy is declining and falling below steady growth, this stage is called depression.   - Consumers don't borrow or spend because they are pessimistic about the economic outlook. As the central bank cuts interest rates, loans become cheap, but businesses fail to take advantage of loans because they can't see a clear picture of when demand will start picking up. There will be less demand for loans. The business ends up sitting on inventories & pare back production, which they already produced.   - Companies lay off more and more employees, and the unemployment rate soars and confidence flatters.   5) Trough   :   - When economic growth becomes negative, the outlook looks hopeless. Further decline in demand and supply of goods and services will lead to more fall in prices.   - It shows the maximum negative situation as the economy reached its lowest point. All economic indicators will be worse. Ex. The highest rate of unemployment, and No demand for goods and services(lowest), etc. After the completion, good time starts with the recovery phase.   6) Recovery   :   Affected sectors:   Industrials, materials, real estate   - As a result of low prices, the economy begins to rebound from a negative growth rate, and demand and production are both starting to increase.   - Companies stop shedding employees and start finding to meet the current level of demand. As a result, they are compelled to hire. As the months pass, the economy is once in expansion.   - The business cycle is important because investors attempt to concentrate their investments on those that are expected to do well at a certain time of the cycle.   - Government and the central bank also take action to establish a healthy economy. The government will increase expenditure and also take steps to increase production.   After the recovery phases, the economy again enters the expansion phase.   Safe heaven/Defensive Stocks - It maintains or anticipates its values over the crisis, then does well. We can even expect good returns in these asset classes. Ex. utilities, health care, consumer staples, etc.   (\"WE WILL DISCUSS MORE IN OUR UPCOMING ARTICLE DUE TO ARTICLE LENGTH.\")   It's a depression condition for me that I couldn't complete my discussion after spending many days in writing this article.

        "text": "Investor's behavioral traits and personality characteristics play a crucial role in building investors' risk profiles. It is too difficult to categorize personalities. We all are humans who are different from each other. Years of research have led to the development of a basic clarification system.   There are main frameworks available for psychographic analysis. One of these systems is provided by   BB&K   . BB&K, which stands for   Bailard, Biehl, and Kaiser   , which figures out what kind of investor you are based on two things: how sure you are about things and how you go about making decisions. The first part is about how you handle stuff like your job, money, and success in life.   The second part looks at whether you're the type who thinks things through carefully or if you're more impulsive. Imagine these two parts like two lines on a graph: one is about how confident or anxious you are, and the other is about how cautious or quick to act you are.   The Adventurer   : Adventurers are characterized by their high confidence and a willingness to take significant risks. They are impulsive and tend to make bold investment decisions. They believe in their ideas and often concentrate on their investments.   The Celebrity   : Celebrities thrive on being part of the action and fear missing out on the latest trends. They often seek advice from investment advisers as they lack their investment ideas. Their investment beliefs can be inconsistent and confused.   The Individualist   : Individualists possess a balanced mix of confidence, caution, and analytical thinking. They prefer to conduct their research, avoiding extreme market volatility. They often take a contrarian approach and carefully assess the value of investments.   The Guardian   : Guardians are typically individuals who are cautious about wealth preservation, often those approaching retirement. They are highly risk-averse, avoiding volatile investments. Their primary concern is stability and security.   The Straight-Arrow   : Straight-Arrows are a balanced composite of the other four investor types. They are willing to accept medium risk and are open to various investment strategies. They can exhibit characteristics of different personas, influenced by recent investment experiences.   It's worth noting that investors can sometimes change their behavior from their usual approach. This change can be influenced by recent experiences in the world of investing. For example, a person who is usually careful might become more daring and adventurous when they've had a series of successful investments. On the other hand, most investors tend to become more cautious and conserve.   Importance:   Understanding this cycle of changing investor behaviors is crucial for investors because it helps them adapt to market conditions. By recognizing that their own investment approach may shift in response to recent experiences, investors can make more informed decisions. This awareness allows them to strike a balance between risk and caution, potentially optimizing their investment strategies to better navigate the ups and downs of the market.

The micro cap ETF is bouncing off the bottom end of a regression channel, however a warning signal is that it's still below an area of resistance.

As you know prior support becomes resistance once the level is broken so although it is good progress that we are bouncing off of the bottom end of the regression channel I wouldn't get too carried away as it's still below an area of resistance.

Zoom shares   ZOOM   rose seven-fold in 2020 as sales surged after millions of workers were stuck at home because of COVID-19 restrictions. By 2021, though, revenue growth slowed, and the stock plunged. The company has shed at least $100 billion in market value since then.   Meanwhile over the past two years, the stock has stagnated because Zoom's video-conferencing service is needed less as businesses continue pushing staff back to the office.   Zoom, one of the main enablers and beneficiaries of remote work, in August 2023 has asked its employees to head back to the office. The company announced that employees living within 50 miles of a Zoom office must work there at least two days a week.   \"We believe that a structured hybrid approach  meaning employees that live near an office need to be onsite two days a week to interact with their teams  is most effective for Zoom,\" a spokesperson said in a statement. \"As a company, we are in a better position to use our own technologies, continue to innovate, and support our global customers.\"   As pandemic Covid-19 is over, many other companies have announced return-to-office mandates, but Zoom's change of heart is surprising given the role its technology plays in remote work. The company's video-conferencing service became so ubiquitous during the pandemic that its corporate name became a verb describing the act of firing up a video chat to connect with coworkers online.   People are back to Travelling. The annual graph for   RPM   , Revenue Passenger Miles for U.S. Air Carrier Domestic and International, Scheduled Passenger Flights.   Meanwhile, there're some important things to say.   Warren Buffett's 99-year-old business partner, Charlie Munger, was surprisingly embraced Zoom during the pandemic. Eric Yuan, the founder and CEO of the video-conferencing platform, celebrated the veteran investor's endorsement of his product on an earnings in 2021.   \"I have fallen in love with Zoom,\" Munger, the vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, said in a CNBC interview filmed at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in May, 2021.   \"Zoom is here to stay. It just adds so much convenience.\"    Munger added that he struck a deal in Australia using the communications tool. He trumpeted its prospects at Daily Journal's annual meeting in February, 2021 as well.    When the pandemic is over, I don't think we're going back to just the way things were,\" the newspaper publisher's chairman said.     We're going to do a lot less travel and a lot more Zooming.   Charlie loves Zoom and uses it frequently for business and to keep in touch with his family, as it's difficult for him to travel.   His business advice was to build a better product or offer a better solution, that it's all about competition, and that successful people are those with the acumen to understand life better than everyone else. He said it's up to you to work harder and better than the next person.   Charlie also said investments are better than money in the bank, and it's important to go to the office to work in person.   The main graph says, Zoom equities just hit the major all history ground support near $59 per share.",

        "text": "Watching AMZN for a potential Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern to develop on the Daily Chart.  AMZN sold off pretty hard leading up to earnings on 10/26/23 only to experience a large gap to the upside (represented by the blue parallel channel) to open the session on the morning after the report.  The stock had been mainly trading inside a Descending Channel(D) since making its most recent high of $145.86 on 9/14/2023.  After setting a 52wk Low in Dec '22, the stock began to recover before hitting the 200(MA)(D) and falling sharply as a result of a miss on Q4 '23 earnings announced on 2/2/23.  The stock fell more than 20% before finding support and going on a straight rocket ship that it has been on since March of this year.  The run has been fueled by three consecutive earnings beats, with the most recent being a few days ago on 10/26/23.  As a result, AMZN has beaten projections for all three quarters of '23 and looks poised to have a strong Q4 with the holiday season approaching.  AMZN has risen significantly over the last two sessions since the release of the earnings report, however the overall sentiment of the market is FEARFUL, and stocks have been in a corrective mode creating lots of downward pressure.  The stock seems to have found support at the 200MA(D) and closed today above both the 50MA(D) and 100MA(D).  This area also coincides with the Golden Zone of a Fib Retracement from the last earnings miss, to the most recent high.  This area is represented by the yellow rectangle encompassing the Head, just below what would be the Left and Right Shoulders.  Expectations are for a pullback in the area of $134-$136 down to the $123-$125 area, (completing the Head and forming the Right Shoulder) before continuing its upward trajectory.  Price action should be interpreted as it develops, and this serves as a general idea how the chart could start to take shape.  Levels should be treated as zones and entries taken on a real time basis.   Trade Scenarios   1.  Early Takeoff   Stock had been trading in a Descending Channel(D) since August.  The stock temporarily experienced a false breakout above the channel on 9/8/23 but returned back inside the channel eight trading sessions later.  It traded inside the channel for about two weeks before another failed breakout attempt on 10/12/23 and ultimately falling back into the channel.  On Thursday 10/26/23 (the last session before earnings were released) the stock found support at the bottom of the channel and the Golden Fib Zone creating a nice bounce allowing the stock to close above the Descending Channel(D).  With strong momentum the stock could possibly take off from here however that seems unlikely.  The safer play would be to wait for Bullish price action to occur on a retest of the top of the Descending Channel(D).  If the overall market begins to show signs of strength, this could be a logical spot for the stock to bounce.  This would still be an early aggressive entry.   2.Conservative   The safest way to enter the trade would be to let the pattern develop and take entry when the stock breaks the neckline.  For added confirmation wait for a break and retest of the neckline but be mindful that this could result in missing the trade completely.   3.  Aggressive   If the formation is to play out it may be advantageous to wait for a pullback/reaction at the potential neckline.  Entry would then be taken if BULLISH price action developed at the anticipated area of the right shoulder.   *This is just one of many scenarios/formations that could develop given the stock's current price point and technical levels. It will be important to watch price action over the next couple of days to determine the ultimate direction of the asset.   *Bias is to the upside, but it is important to watch the overall sentiment of the market.  A break below the area identified as the Left Shoulder would be the first warning sign, and a break below the area identified as the Head would totally invalidate the trade's parameters. Should that occur, it would not immediately mean the stock has turned BEARISH however, it would mean the stock should be re-evaluated before entry.   *RSI(D) has confirmed DBL BTM, breaking above the neckline and currently resides in BULLISH territory with a reading over 50.   *Watching Bollinger Bands(D), AVP(52wk Low) POC, VAH, and VAL for added support/resistance.",

        "text": "Thinking about the big picture   I always stress how important it is for long-term investors not to get caught up in any single quarter's performance. If you plan to own a stock for five or 10 years, what happens in any three-month period is hardly important in the grand scheme of things. This same approach should be applied to Alphabet.   Yes, the market reacted negatively to the tech giant's latest earnings. But a valid question to ask is: Is this company's long-term competitive position under threat? I think the answer to that question, based on the facts, is a resounding no.   Let's focus on Alphabet's bread-and-butter search business. According to statcounter.com, it still has a monopolistic position, with just under a 92% share of the global market.   Is OpenAI's ChatGPT integration really enough for consumers to ditch Google and start using Microsoft's Bing search engine? It's a stretch for someone to believe this to be true. To be fair, the market could shift radically in the next few years, but that is almost impossible to predict. And right now Google is still the leader in search, and as a result of that, digital advertising as well.   In order to position itself for the AI wars, Alphabet has just agreed to invest $2 billion in Anthropic, an AI start-up that has created a chatbot that is a direct competitor to ChatGPT. Maybe more importantly, Alphabet is planning to launch Gemini, its internally developed generative AI model, which could be more versatile and powerful than OpenAI's offerings. This could quiet the doubters who think this business is falling behind.   Additionally, investors have to ask if the growth of AI will really bring about entirely new use cases for consumers and businesses, or if this revolutionary technology will simply improve what already exists. As of right now, it looks like the latter will happen. And \"with 15 products that each serve half a billion people, and six that serve over 2 billion each,\" according to CEO Sundar Pichai, Alphabet already owns some of the most popular, widely adopted internet properties on the face of the planet. This gives it a huge leg up to introduce AI innovations to an existing user base.",

Building a great business like Airbnb (ABNB 6.18%) doesn't happen overnight, but once it gets going, the growth can come almost automatically. For Airbnb, the added benefit is that free cash flow accelerates as the company grows.   Airbnb Gross Booking Top Estimates   Active listings on Airbnb grew 19% in the third quarter from the same period last year, with \"double-digit supply growth across all regions and market types,\" the company said.   Further, the company noted international markets were gaining momentum for booking. Cross-border nights booked grew by 17% in the third quarter compared to a year ago, the company said.   Gross booking value climbed 17% year over year to $18.3 billion, topping estimates of $17.9 billion.   The average daily rate customers pay for a stay  a closely watched metric for investors  climbed 3% year over year to $161, ahead of estimates of $158.   Price Momentum   ABNB is trading in the middle of its 52-week range and below its 200-day simple moving average.   What does It Imply?   Investors are still evaluating the share price, but the stock still appears to have some downward momentum.",

        "text": "3 Panel Chart   Top Right Chart:   -Daily chart using bollinger bands.  Both bands are open, and price has been dragging along the bottom band.  Price has pierced the bottom band several times, which doesn't happen very often.  Sometimes when price stabs through a band, that could be a signal the strength of the move has peaked and is now slowing down.  A clue to know for sure is to look at how both bands appear. If both bands are vertical, then the move is powerful.  In this case, the upper band appears to be flattening, meaning the move is weakening.   -Also Friday's candle printed a bearish engulfing candle.  This can be a bearish signal for the short term.   Left Chart:   -This weekly chart concerns me.  First, a death cross occurred on July of 2022, and the 50 ma (green line) has been acting as resistance and pushing price down.   -Also price has been bouncing around in a descending parallel channel.  Last week price broke and closed below this channel (yellow arrow) and this is what concerns me the most.   -In 2022 price fell below this channel (yellow oval) and had trouble getting back into the channel.  It took 91 days for a confirmation candle to get back in .   -Usually when price breaks below a channel, that line now becomes resistance.  If Paypal fails to get itself back into this channel, we could see price drop significantly while it tries to battle its way back inside.   Right Bottom Chart:   -This is the 2 month chart.  I like this chart because it's a big picture chart, and is more accurate than the lower time frames.   -With the bollinger bands pulling price down on the daily, and price breaking below the descending channel on the weekly, Paypal could fall between the $47-$40 level.(Orange Parallel Lines)   -Here's the warning:  If Paypal falls below the $40 level, we need to monitor this carefully because you don't want a 2 month candle to close below $30. (Purple line)  Thirty dollars is Paypal's all time low, and closing below this could be a death spiral, because there's no support below this.   This hasn't occurred yet, nor are we close to it, so no need to panic over it.  It's just something you should be mindful about.   -On a bullish note, $47 is Paypal's support level.  Currently price is at $50. If price can bounce up from here, the weekly candle could possibly get itself back into the descending channel in the left chart.  And potentially start heading to the upper line of the descending parallel channel.   The key to watch is the weekly chart on the left:   -If price fails to get back into the channel, then the bottom line will act as resistance, and push price lower.   -If price is able to get back into the channel, then watch the stochastic rsi. (Orange circle)   If the stoch starts to point upwards with a cross, then price could be heading up towards the upper line of the descending channel.   -Never have your mind set on price going up or down.   There's always a bullish and bearish scenario.  And be ready to adjust when things change.   The only guarantee is that there are no guarantees.",

Depending on what happens Sunday night going into Monday it's setting up for a bounce.   Bottom graph has a line that suggests oversold. In my mind it is set up if the line remains below the dotted line Monday Oct 30. If it goes up above then maybe toss the idea, it happened last year in June and September where it gapped up and I tossed the idea, but it still did rocket up :(. For the one a couple of weeks ago it didn't quite get there, but at the early part it was above my little green eclipse.   Maybe down early in the first part of the day, then reverse up and hard for the next few days? Bonus points if it just falls through the lower Bollinger, at which point I'll probably enter. It actually is currently under.   Short of a gap up there's a pretty good chance this set up actually is... well set up! The first time since Jan 2022!   From the low of Monday Oct 30 -   Let's Say   5% chance of ~+10% by Nov 2 (top yellow circle)   40% chance of +5.5% by Nov 2 (lower yellow circle)   60% chance of +5.5% by Nov 13 (right yellow circle)   Don't really think we will get +10% with how things are set up, but it does happen sometimes....   Green eclipse is things going according to the idea, above is a bonus, below is a fail.   You might be asking 40%? 60%? so you're flipping a coin? could go up, could go down? Well it's 40-60% chance of +5.5%, nothing is guaranteed and that's why you have responsible stops in place.",

I have a follower that stated they were already up 90% on some options they entered. Tell me, what other kind of methods can produce those type of results?? I'll wait...   On the chart I used the 15min which is the smallest I can use for a public post. I left the mini 5 wave count on there from the beginning of this move up to signify the importance of it. It's hard to sustain a new trend without a healthy move to start it off. After the initial 5-wave we had a 3-wave retrace into wave ii. Wave iii really stands out as it is the most powerful move in this structure. On the 3min it suggests we have topped on neg div and will head lower tomorrow in our micro-wave (ii). However, on the larger time frame it appears as if we need OMH to finish out this move up and the fibs support OMH. At this time though, the OMH is my ALT as signified by the turquoise count and yellow box.   Once we start to retrace for (ii) I will make an update with the target to the post through a comment. At this time, I expect it to be in the mid-low $16 range. It is on this wave (ii) that I intend to purchase more calls should price behave appropriately. I will make an update on here if I place any trades.   Bonam Fortunam,   --Tyler",

As you notice, there is a key in the upper right corner labeling my counts and their priority/color. As of now we are in my target box and structure looks as if it could be considered complete.   As you notice on the chart my blue fib retracement lines show we're very close to the 0.382. Price should ideally be contained by this as it is a normal ending for wave 4's. I wouldn't be surprised if we made OMH, but I don't want us to cross the blue 0.5 fib though as this would mean we are likely in something other than wave (4). Don't forget though, this count isn't invalidated until price breaches $234.58. That would mean (4) raises all the way to cross into wave (2) territory, but we will get clues before then.   A couple other things that are leading me to believe we're headed lower very soon is the S&P and NQ both appear to need a retrace (micro b) to the downside. Looking at the 3min chart we have some neg div building signaling a move to the downside. As you see below, I believe the reason for the explosiveness is we are in c wave of (4). Wave (2) was long and deep so I would expect (4) to be short and shallow. Hence the thought process we shouldn't cross the blue 0.382, or if we do, not by much.   One thing that does have me slightly concerned with this count though, is the MACD on the 1Hr chart. It has risen very high for a wave 4 and has almost breached the B wave high. If we drop for (5) before rising much more it is no big deal, but something I'm watching none the less. As I have said before, it is the little things that most miss yet are the most important. Due to this little sore thumb sticking out though, it has caused me to add a 2nd ALT to the chart. This is saying that we have indeed already bottomed and will head up towards the $300 range soon. I find this is a VERY low probability but want to be prepared for it nonetheless. Don't lose sight of us coming to the end of a trend. For this to change direction and start heading up / change trend peoples phycology must change. This usually manifests as choppy price action towards the end of the count as the average trader's sub-conscience slowly changes. When it finally does change though...that is what causes the rip your face off move we see in wave 3's. Good luck y'all. I'm taking my Gma to a Dr. Apt tomorrow a.m so I may not be available part of the morning but will update when able.   Bonam Fortunam,   --Tyler",

EPS = Is calculated by subtracting any preferred dividends from a company's net income and dividing that amount by the number of shares outstanding.   PE = The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is the ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its per-share earnings.   PB = The Price-to-book value (P/B) is the ratio of the market value of a company's shares (share price) over its book value of equity.   PS = The price-to-sales P/S ratio is calculated by dividing the stock price by the underlying company's sales per share.   FCF = Free cash flow (FCF) represents the cash that a company generates after accounting for cash outflows to support operations and maintain its capital assets.   Cash to debt ratio = The cash flow-to-debt ratio is the ratio of a company's cash flow from operations to its total debt. A ratio of 1 or greater is best, whereas a ratio of less than 1 shows that a firm isn't generating sufficient cash flow to meet its debt obligations.   PEG ratio = The price/earnings to growth ratio (PEG ratio) is a stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divided by the growth rate of its earnings for a specified time period. Generally, a PEG below 1 means a stock is undervalued.   Current ratio = The current ratio is Current Assets divided by Current Liabilities. It's a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations or those due within one year. In general, a current ratio of 2 or higher is considered good, and anything lower than 2 is a cause for concern.",

        "text": "Today   DFS   pierced the bottom of the gap that was created on October 19, when the stock sold off following earnings.   The market's attitude this week has been that \"bad is good\". GDP forecasts are coming down, retailers are warning about consumers lowering their spending level,   AAPL   gave a muted earnings release. All this meant that the Fed left rates untouched at their FOMC meeting this week, and dollar and long rates pulled back pretty hard. I think the narrative that's in the market now, is that things are \"not great\", but the Fed is finally starting to see it, and so we'll at least be spared further rate hikes.   The point of that narrative is that we may get spared a hard landing, which means no recession, and no wide-spread unemployment.  For banks and credit card lenders this means that all the loan loss reserves they built up over the past few quarters may not actually be required to cover future losses. Instead, they may get released, leading to higher future earnings, or at the very least, future quarters will not be depressed by further reserve builds. At the same time, the spend-down of the post-pandemic surplus household savings has brought significant increases in credit card debt, which is enormously profitable for lenders, as long as credit losses stay contained. So, this might be a Goldilocks scenario for stocks like $DFS.   Long story short: I am long a Dec 1 88/92 call spread @1.52. Risking $1.52 for the potential of earning $2.42 is not a tremendous risk/reward. Still, I accept it because I think that the narrative just works for this beaten down name. Why am I capping the trade at $92? Because I am playing the earning gap, and also because above $92 resistance from the VWAP off the YTD High will come into play (declining red line).",

Analysts are expecting earnings growth of 10% for the third quarter of 2023. This is a significant improvement over the second quarter, and it suggests that the economy is continuing to grow at a healthy pace.   In addition, the Federal Reserve has signaled that it is taking a more dovish approach to monetary policy. This means that interest rates are likely to remain low for the foreseeable future, which is supportive for equity markets.   Finally, the unemployment rate in the United States held steady at 3.8% in September 2023. This is a very low unemployment rate, and it is a sign that the labor market is strong.   When all of these factors are considered, it is clear that the stock market is poised for a strong Christmas bull market in 2023.   Investors who are looking to capitalize on this opportunity may want to consider buying stocks that are expected to benefit from continued economic growth and low interest rates. Some sectors that may be particularly well-suited for this environment include technology, consumer discretionary, and healthcare.   Of course, it is important to do your own research before investing in any stock. But with the Christmas bull market on the horizon, now is a good time to start thinking about how to position your portfolio for success.",

This one is basically all fundamental:   GS just reported earnings, and they took a bunch of charges, which made 3Q2023 a lot worse than 3Q2022. They did, however, still beat estimates.   It looks to me like GS is finally getting out of a lot of the headwinds they had over the past couple of years:   IPO and M&A activity has been very muted over the last several quarters, and we are finally starting to see a decent pipeline emerge.   The bank is getting ready to jettison its Apple partnership, and its whole consumer-facing Marcus franchise.   GS significantly cut exposure to commercial real estate, which looks like it will produce losses for years to come.   The WFH controversy that has caused a lot of dissatisfaction within the ranks seems to have died down.   Most importantly, today's earnings seem to be met with relief by investors that it wasn't as bad as feared. From a valuation perspective banks have been cheap for a long time, and continue to look cheap to me. And IV is very low by historical comparison.

        "text": "Price action at the lower border of an upward channel has a higher chance of moving upward than price action at the upper border of a downward channel. This is because an upward channel is formed by higher highs and higher lows, which indicates an uptrend. When the price reaches the lower border of the channel, it finds support at a previous level and is more likely to bounce back and continue the uptrend.   On the other hand, a downward channel is formed by lower highs and lower lows, which indicates a downtrend. When the price reaches the upper border of the channel, it encounters resistance at a previous level and is more likely to be rejected and continue the downtrend.   Of course, there is no guarantee that price will always move in the expected direction. However, the technical analysis principles described above suggest that price action at the lower border of an upward channel has a higher chance of moving upward than price action at the upper border of a downward channel.   It is important to note that price action is just one factor to consider when making trading decisions.

(PFE) on NYSE (Monthly Timeframe)   The provided chart exhibits the long-term price movement of Pfizer Inc. on the New York Stock Exchange, with data captured on a monthly timeframe, extending over a period from roughly 2006 to the current date.   Observations:   The PFE stock observed a substantial rally that commenced around 2018, propelling the price to reach an apex slightly above $61.71.   Post its peak, a pronounced correction is evident, causing the stock to retreat to its current price region near $31.16.   The Fibonacci retracement levels on the chart highlight pivotal zones of potential resistance and support. As of now, the stock is oscillating near the 0.5 retracement level ($34.09).   Over the longer term, the stock has been largely range-bound, especially between 2006 to 2018, indicating regions of historical resistance and support.   The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Stochastic Oscillator reflect a bearish momentum with the potential for some upside, considering they are in or approaching the oversold region.   Short to Mid-Term Targets:   Immediate support appears to be at the 0.618 Fibonacci level ($29.75). Should the price maintain above this level, the immediate resistance to watch would be the 0.5 level ($34.09).   Beyond this, the 0.382 level at approximately $42.37 presents the next significant resistance.   Long-Term Perspective:   Should the stock regain bullish momentum, overcoming the historical peak around $61.71 would be crucial for setting the stage for potential new highs.   Conversely, if the downtrend continues and breaches the 0.618 level ($29.75), the stock may seek support around its previous low regions, notably close to $20.   Conclusion:   Investors are encouraged to pay heed to the evolving price dynamics and corroborate the technical indications with other relevant market news or potential catalysts. As always, considering protective measures like setting a stop-loss can aid in risk management.",

        "text": "**TSLA SELL/BUY Trading Strategy Based on Revenue Reports**   In this strategy, we're considering potential TSLA buy and sell opportunities based on historical and forecasted revenue reports. Tesla has undergone two stock splits, which have had a positive impact on the growth of CFDs (Contracts for Difference). Typically, winter and autumn reports tend to be negative. From the stock splits, we've identified strong support in the $75 to $115 range. This price level is crucial, and the \"smart money\" concept suggests we have weaker support above that level, in the $170 to $180 range.   Following the latest stock split, prices surged to the $200 to $300 range, leaving an unclosed gap at $150. Our strong high is above $300, with an all-time high (ATH) above $400. Bullish seasonal support was broken, and prices reverted to a bearish seasonal trend after negative reports. We've traded within a range of $160 to $300, employing range trading, but this was disrupted after breaking the $240 support level, resulting in a drop to $190.   In this bearish trend, looking ahead to forecasted negative seasonal reports, we aim to push the resistance level down to $180 to close the gap at least halfway and then rebound northward toward the seasonal ATH above $400.   Our long-term rebound and growth are based on Tesla's high potential as a market leader in the electric vehicle segment, underlined by upcoming global legislative changes aimed at phasing out internal combustion engines by the year 2035, changes that have been in implementation since the early 2010s.",

Our primary wave count for both the QQQ and the SPX is that we have formed a leading diagonal to the downside which is now pulling back, and is about to launch into a total collapse.   No matter which wave count I pick though, it is clear as day to me that the market is not going to be rising very much higher for much longer. The longest I could see this market staying up before the almost inevitable crash occurs is until the end of the year, but this is not what I expect at all. The more \"bullish\" counts do not predict a rise -- they merely predict that we could take slightly longer to fall.   For these reasons, we have purchased some deep OTM QQQ puts (330 strike) that will expire on 3/15/23, giving the market some time to bend over. If we are right about the leading diagonal, these puts will be worth about 1000% more, and we will make a gigantic profit.",

The first pattern on todays chart is the potential basing pattern that began in August. Its bottom was slightly above the May trough. That could suggest that selling pressure is waning in the social-media stock.   Second are the pair of high-volume candles on October 16 and 25. The first came after   The Verge   reported that SNAP was setting ambitious internal targets for monetization and engagement. The second followed better-than-expected quarterly results.   At that time, investors were nervous about global tensions hurting growth. But if those worries fade, traders could target the third pattern: a large bearish gap that followed weak quarterly results in July.

        "text": "In the past three years, Sundial Growers Inc.'s stock price has experienced a decline. While this may deter some investors, it presents an opportunity for those with a long-term investment horizon and a high risk tolerance.   Sundial Growers Inc. currently has a cash ratio of 1.81, indicating its ability to cover short-term obligations exclusively with cash and cash equivalents. This liquidity measure is a positive sign for the company's financial health.   Furthermore, Sundial Growers Inc.'s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is currently -3.65. This low ratio suggests that the stock may be undervalued and presents an opportunity for investors to buy at a lower price.   Market analysts estimate Sundial Growers Inc.'s fair value to be 0.36 at the moment. This indicates that the stock may have significant upside potential.   Considering these factors, the trading idea is to buy Sundial Growers Inc. stock. The long-term moderate risk strategy focuses on companies with a low P/E ratio, low price-to-operating cash flows ratio, low price fair value, and a high cash ratio.   With its current cash ratio, low P/E ratio, and potential for growth, Sundial Growers Inc. presents an attractive investment opportunity for those willing to take a long-term view and tolerate higher risk.   Technical Outlook   Sundial Growers (SNDL) bulls are eyeing a key resistance level at $1.60 as the next milestone if they can maintain their dominance. The stock is quickly approaching this level, with only 7 cents to go. A breakthrough could lead to further gains in the short run.   In the latest session, Sundial Growers continued its 5-day uptrend by gaining 6.25%. Yesterday, the stock spiked higher to highs around 1.53 before market bears pushed the price back down towards 1.45. By the end of the session, it settled at $1.53.   Sundial Growers has been trending downward for the last month. It currently has a market cap of $398.56 million. Yesterday's trading volume of 1.87 million shares was 84% lower than average.   Key insights:   Sundial Growers is just 7 cents away from a key resistance level at $1.60.   Pushing above this level could enable the stock to gain more ground in the short-term.   Sundial Growers made an initial breakout above its 21-day Simple Moving Average at $1.52, indicating potential for a new bullish phase.   The stock is currently rated as \"Neutral\" by technical analysts.",

The 4H MACD formed a Bullish Cross 2 days ago and last time we saw such a bullish formation this low, was on August 21. That was straight after the first Low of the Falling Wedge, which initiated the bullish sequence that formed the Lower High of September 15 marginally below the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level.   The August Falling Wedge Low was, on a shorter term framework, the Head of an Inverse Head and Shoulders (IH&S) pattern. Technically this is a bullish reversal pattern seen on market bottoms and as we saw it didn't fail to deliver a rebound. Typically their targets are the 2.0 Fibonacci extension only that time the rise exceeded it.   We see the same kind of IH&S emerging on the current bottom of the Wedge and now is forming its Right Shoulder. This time, the 2.0 Fib ext of the IH&S is marginally below the 0.786 Fib retracement level from the Wedge's last Lower High. As a result, we will target $250, which meets all the criteria for a new Lower High of the Falling Wedge.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------   ** Please LIKE , FOLLOW , SHARE  and COMMENT  if you enjoy this idea!

        "text": "AAPL shares rose approximately 1.2% during the session yesterday in anticipation of a strong Q3 report. It actually turned out better than predicted:    earnings per share: actual = USD 1.46; forecast = USD 1.39;    gross income: actual = USD 89.49 billion; forecast = USD 89.34 billion.   However, as a result, the price of AAPL shares decreased; in the pre-market on Friday, the share price was about USD 171.50, although yesterday it closed at USD 177.78 according to the NASDAQ exchange (minus 3.50%).   The reason is the company's disappointing plans for the future.   Tim Cook refused to answer a question about Apple's investments in AI. And Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri failed to reassure investors that there would be a surge in sales over the holiday period, saying gross revenue would be similar to what it was a year ago. So analysts can expect the company to continue to show a decline in sales, which already looks like a trend for 2023.   AAPL stock price performance shows that the stock market is largely a reflection of hopes, emotions and belief in rumors. In fact:    the price continues to move in a downward trend (shown by the blue channel);    growth to its upper limit in the hope of a positive report turned into a collapse;    the opening of trading today may take place at the bottom of the channel;    bears may attack the psychological level of USD 170 per share today. This level is also important because it is approximately 50% of the price increase from the March lows to the highs of the year.   If the USD 170 level is broken by the bears with the extension of the candle body and increased volumes, it could become an important resistance further down the line. So close to losing the status of the most valuable company.   This article represents the opinion of the Companies operating under the FXOpen brand only.

Yesterday's price movement was another testament of buyer's weighty positioning of this soon-to-be-massive-valuation stock. It is named the future MSFT of today's era.   The recent price growth (+6% yesterday's session) was augmented by another good news:   Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) recently acquired about 6 million more shares of Rubicon Technologies (NYSE:RBT), bringing its stake in the firm to 6.2%. Palantirs purchase of the shares appears to have been required by a deal that the company signed with Rubicon last year. As of this writing, PLTR stock is up by about 5%.   Palantir creates and markets data analysis tools. Meanwhile, Rubicon operates a digital marketplace for waste and recycling service. Rubicon is also one of Palantirs customers.   In our monthly chart, Histogram is recording 5 straight months of ascend -- talk about 'value' strength of this stock. On tri-monthly data, the elusive bottom line shift has appeared after 3 years.  This is already a huge hint of the momentum going upside. Net buy volume has surged an impressive 20+ % and it continues to grow on a weekly basis.   Coming QTR2 earnings (Aug. 2023) results is expected to come in 'green' at $536M.   Expect more significant price growth for PLTR. And it's not all hype, there is meat into it.   At current valuation, it is still a bargain in my opinion. A 3-digit valuation in the future will not be farfetched based on metrics and progressive developments on the company.

        "text": "Continuing to look at C3.ai the chart appears that a bottom might be near.  A falling wedge pattern is well defined within the LongTerm Downtrend.  Also within that as identified in a light blue horizontal box is the current trading channel of approximately 6 weeks.   The TSI is still relatively weak but overall neutral along with the MFI. The most recent bearish formation is the Bearish 50 day EMA Cross of the 200 day EMA. As C3.ai has been topping out along the upper trendline of the falling wedge I believe a low of $23.50 can still be made before the wedge formation is completed and C3.ai breaks out to the upside. Measuring the backside of the wedge, the height gives us a range of $9.40 from the breakout point so if $23.50 is the number that take's it back to $32.90 for a 40% move and that coincides with the Top Trendline of the Long Term Price Channel  When it does breakout the first line of resistance will be at $26.60 and that would be good for 13.2%. Overall I believe the worst is over and that going into the next financials to be reported in 6 weeks there is more Upwards potential than not. A breakout above $26.60 will take C3.ai to the target price of $32.90.  Please note that for the past 2 months trading volume has been fairly weak and for validation of the breakout from the Falling Wedge, trading volume should increase by 25-50% or more daily.",

The Bitcoin mining firm mined a record 1,245 BTC during May 2023 thanks to increased hash rates and transaction fees.   The Bitcoin miner has increased its Unrestricted Bitcoin Holdings to 12,259 BTC, worth roughly $333 million.   Marathons stock (MARA) surged by almost 7% following the latest mining metrics.   Bitcoin mining giant Marathon Digital has reported optimistic metrics for the month of May 2023. The Fort Lauderdale-based firm mined 77% more BTC in May as compared to the previous month. The increase in mining output was attributed to surging hash rates and transaction fees thanks to the growing popularity of Bitcoin ordinals. The Bitcoin miner revealed that in some cases transaction fees were so high that they exceeded the 6.25 BTC block reward.   Marathon Digitals Share Price Up 7%   According to the unaudited Bitcoin production and miner installation updates published by Marathon Digital Holdings, the Bitcoin mining firm mined 1,245 BTC during May 2023, marking a 77% increase from April. The latest BTC addition brought the firms year-to-date mined BTC number to 4,141 BTC. The bitcoin miner also increased its operational hash rate by 9% to 15.2 EH/s and installed hash rate by 13% to 20.1 EH/s in May. The Bitcoin miner has increased its Unrestricted Bitcoin Holdings to 12,259 BTC, worth roughly $333 million.   With the construction of Applied Digitals facility in Ellendale, ND progressing and optimizations across our fleet continuing, we believe we are on track to reach our 23 EH/s target near the middle of this year.   Fred Thiel, Chairman and CEO of Marathon Digital Holdings   Marathons CEO Fred Thiel stated that apart from the Bitcoin mining operations, the firm also collaborated with Brink to raise nearly $800,000 for Bitcoin core developers, of which $500,000 was contributed by the Bitcoin miner. The latest Bitcoin mining metrics had a bullish impact on Marathon Digitals stock (MARA). The share price gained nearly 7% after the numbers for May 2023 were released. At the time of writing, the stock was trading at $10.03.",

I may use RSI, MACD, or a Delta Volume lower study. Other than that I only ever use a couple of moving averages, maybe VWAP on the chart above. But here I have used Fibonacci Triangle pattern to identify a long term trend on Cigna. This makes sense. As the health insurance market would cause the stock to stagnate during the summer and autumn months. In the USA, people are only enrolling in new plans for health insurance during the Winter and Spring. That is soon to come, and I will expect large profits for CIGNA in the coming months. I would personally buy a Diagonal Call spread on CI. I would maybe sell a call around the 350 strike for early december and buy maybe the 360 Strike on sometime in february. These diagonal positions allow you to profit from the favorable aspects of both the vertical and the calendar spread at the same time. If you go wide enough with them strike and date wise, it can be hard to lose on them barring a black swan event. Especially if you use a double diagonal, legging in with another on the other side of the option chain. This is similar to an iron condor, with a big difference, your risk is much higher but your actual likelihood of losing can be made to be almost non-existent. They are Vega and Theta positive. Which means that if volatility shoots up and price starts dropping on you, it gains value, allowing you to either adjust, or exit for a profit.",

Between current lows and ATH, we can anticipate a decent rally before resuming a larger move lower (if that would happen in future). At these lows its great price range to accumulate and build a position using risk management and DCA strategy. It's been trading back it forth between $1.15-1.40; approx 15-20% difference in gains. You can try trade it back it forth with focus on taking some profits to create a lower cost position and then using those profits to buy more shares. If you want to really play safe, aim to sell 50% at 2x (or 3x) and hold the remaining 50% balance of your DNA portfolio 100% risk free for life (e.i  Buy 1000 shares at $1.20 to Sell 500 shares (50%) at $2.40). Just some strategies worth looking into.   As for the current wave count, favoring DNA to be possible ending its 5th and final wave down. Market-wide, things seem risky and tough to support the idea any assets would pump while indices dump. However many times, smaller cap assets tend to get some nice pumps, not always but often. Its a matter of risk to reward while applying a safe risk management strategy. Our goal is profits, small chucks along the way. SO the target zone here is within the pink lines (wave V ending calculation) of $1.26-$0.96 area with the fib extension calculation showing the 1.618 at $0.82 area.

Roku said the better-than-expected revenue improvement was driven by \"strong performance in content distribution and video advertising.\" The company's Roku TV line, which launched in March, also contributed to revenue gains and helped to drive net active account additions.

        "text": "Uranium ore trades is at records highs, as several hedge fund managers are expanding their allocations to uranium stocks, with a conviction that an increasing embrace of nuclear energy as part of a \"green\" future - along with geopolitically-rooted ambitions to reduce dependence on Russian oil and gas -- means the trend has a lot of room to run.   On Wednesday, November 1,  French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in uranium-rich Kazakhstan on the first leg of a trip to Central Asia.   According to   a study   by the World Nuclear Association (WNA,) published in August this year, Kazakhstan possesses 12 percent of the world's uranium resources and in 2021 produced about 21,800 tons. In 2009 it became the world's leading uranium producer, with almost 28 percent of world production. In 2019, the country produced a staggering 43 percent of the world's uranium.   A dozen years after the disaster at Japan's Fukashima reactor put nuclear energy on worldwide probation -- and in, Germany, gave it a death sentence -- various factors are combining to bring it back into the acceptable realm of energy solutions.   UXC URANIUM U3O8 Futures Price, over the past 5 years.   First reason, the International Energy Agency says that, in order to meet \"net zero\" goals -- which describes a state where carbon emitted into the atmosphere matches the amount removed from it - global nuclear generation capacity must double from 2020 levels by 2050.   In addition to nuclear energy coming to the fore as a zero-carbon-emitting power source, it's also seen as a way for the western economies to reduce their need for Russian oil and gas. The fact that Russia currently accounts for about 8% of the world's uranium reserves underscores the need to develop new supply sources. There's also an increasing appetite for nuclear power in Asia and Africa.   Taken together, the uranium-friendly trends could power significant gains in the sector. Uranium equities could see dramatic upside -- 50%, 100%, possibly MultiX more.   The main graph represents technical perspectives for   URA   - The Global X Uranium ETF that provides investors access to a broad range of companies involved in uranium mining and the production of nuclear components, including those in extraction, refining, exploration, or manufacturing of equipment for the uranium and nuclear industries.   The Global X Uranium ETF is 35.66% year-to-date return in this time, that is much stronger against top 4 American well-known indices i.e. S&P500 Index   SPX   (11.95% YTD), Nasdaq-100 Index   NDX   (35.22% YTD), Russell 2000 Index   RUT   (-3.38% YTD) , and Dow Jones Industrial Average   DJI   (1.94% YTD).

The top-line beat affirms the momentum Shopify has been building in recent quarters, which has 70% year to date.   More businesses are signing up for subscriptions and driving steady growth in the company's merchant solutions business. But the stock is also responding to Shopify's improving profitability on the bottom line.   Operating income came in at 7% of revenue, or $122 million, reversing last year's operating loss of $346 million. The company's decision to sell its logistics operation to free up resources and lower expenses is clearly paying off, and shareholders are being rewarded.   Management expects the momentum to continue with the holiday shopping season coming up. For the fourth quarter, revenue is expected to be in the low-to-mid-twenties year over year excluding the impact of sales in the logistics business from the fourth quarter of 2022.   Moreover, free cash flow margin relative to revenue was a healthy 16% in the third quarter, and management expects it to remain in the high-teens range in Q4.   Here's an opportunity to watch   For a stock trading at a high price-to-sales ratio of 12, Shopify hit all the right notes in its latest update. The company should continue to see healthy margins and growing free cash flow over the long term, which could push the stock to new highs.

        "text": "Introduction:   The stock price of Coinbase (COIN), one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, is making waves today with a remarkable 7.3% surge in anticipation of a crucial earnings call scheduled for 17:30 GMT-4. This event has captured the attention of traders and investors, and as the world watches, the burning question is whether Coinbase can beat the high expectations set by the market.   Earnings Expectations:   Market analysts are projecting that Coinbase's Q3 earnings report will reveal revenue of approximately $653 million and earnings per share (EPS) of -0.54. These numbers are indicative of both the potential and the challenges that lie ahead for this cryptocurrency exchange giant.   Q3 Market Dynamics:   Q3, unlike the previous months of July and August, was a relatively quiet period for Coinbase, with the crypto markets experiencing subdued activity. However, September marked a significant turnaround, with volatility levels rising notably. This shift in market dynamics could have a substantial impact on Coinbase's financial performance for the quarter.   Custodian Role in ETFs:   One intriguing development for Coinbase is its role as the custodian for all the bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. This new responsibility presents exciting opportunities and potential growth for the American exchange. As the adoption of cryptocurrency ETFs continues to gain momentum, Coinbase stands to benefit significantly.   Market Conditions:   Furthermore, the broader stock market is also on an upswing today, with Nasdaq gaining 1.4%. Simultaneously, Bitcoin experienced a notable spike, briefly reaching $36,000 before encountering a slight dip. These positive market conditions might be contributing to Coinbase's impressive stock price performance.   Comparative Performance:   In the context of the past month, Coinbase's stock price has risen by a respectable 10%. However, this gain pales in comparison to Bitcoin's impressive 27% increase over the same period. This discrepancy raises questions about whether Coinbase can catch up with the soaring performance of the world's leading cryptocurrency.   Conclusion:   As the clock ticks down to the eagerly anticipated earnings call, all eyes are on Coinbase. The financial results unveiled during this event will provide insights into the cryptocurrency exchange's health and resilience in a rapidly evolving market. Whether Coinbase can outperform expectations or merely meet them, its current surge in stock price is indicative of the market's optimism regarding its potential to capitalize on the evolving crypto landscape. Investors and traders alike will be watching closely to see if Coinbase can deliver on these expectations and continue its journey as a major player in the cryptocurrency industry. The world of cryptocurrency awaits the verdict on Coinbase's Q3 performance with bated breath, aware of the pivotal role it plays in the crypto ecosystem.",

A closer look at the financial metrics reveals earnings per share (EPS) of $5.2138 and strong cash flow, with operating cash flow per share of $14.1336 and free cash flow of $7.2339. Walmart's current ratio is 0.8267, which maintains liquidity even though it indicates tighter working capital management.   Its asset base is supported by a solid book value of $29.5417 per share and a tangible book value of $21.274 per share. Meanwhile, shareholders' equity is $29.5417 per share, interest-bearing debt is $24.991 per share, and the debt-to-equity ratio is 0.8145, indicating significant leverage.   Walmart's valuation multiples, such as a price-to-earnings ratio of 31.8591, a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 0.7087, and a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 5.6228, indicate that the company is relatively valued. Current Market. Additionally, enterprise value multiples such as EV/Sales 0.7894 and EV/EBITDA 14.3509 indicate the market's expectations for future growth and profitability.   The company has a modest dividend yield of 1.3665% and a sustainable payout ratio of 0.4347, indicating a cautious approach to returning income to shareholders. Additionally, an earnings quality ratio of 2.7204 indicates solid profitability.   Technically, Walmart appears to be at the peak of the fifth wave of the Elliott Wave pattern, with the RSI indicator on the 4-hour chart approaching overbought territory. This indicates that a correction phase may be coming. Therefore, it may be prudent to hold off on buying the stock for now. Investors interested in Walmart should watch for a pullback to support around $151, which could signal the start of the next bullish wave and where it may be advantageous to establish a position.   All in all, Walmart stock demonstrates strong financials, and its premium valuation multiple suggests market optimism. However, with technical indicators pointing to a potential near-term correction, the strategic approach will include waiting for a more favorable entry point while focusing on the longer-term fundamentals that support the company's health.",

Another factor to consider is the limitations placed on the EV market by the graphite supply constraints and the effect deteriorating trade relations with China might have on the price of graphite. The graphite supply constraints in conjunction with problems scaling EVs across our decaying electrical grid here in the U.S. could place a hard bid on used, gas powered vehicles in the near term until both the functionality and costs  surrounding the scaling of the EV market become more feasible. The vast majority of the cars sold by   CVNA   are used, more gas powered and cheaper than new cars sold by dealerships.

Following this, the price broke down from the sideways market, entering a downtrend with a sharp move down and finding a bottom at the end of September 2022.   A pullback occurred after the breakdown, lasting throughout Q4 2022. The price pulled back to the previous support area, attempting to turn it into resistance and continue the downtrend. Since the pullback, the price has been consolidating in the form of a descending triangle throughout 2023.   Currently, the price sits at the resistance area of the descending triangle. Concurrently, there's an 'overbought' signal on the stochastic indicator, and the price is under the 200ema.   RGR is presently in a bearish pattern (descending triangle), at a resistance level with an 'overbought' signal, and the previous trend was/is downward (price under the 200ema).

        "text": "Hey traders, I want to share my idea on CCJ, the uranium mining company. I think this stock is showing signs of a pullback after a strong rally in the past few months. Let me explain why.   First of all, the price has reached a major resistance zone around $25, which was the previous high in 2011. This level is likely to act as a barrier for further upside movement. Secondly, the RSI indicator is showing a bearish divergence, meaning that the price is making higher highs while the RSI is making lower highs. This indicates a loss of momentum and a possible reversal. Thirdly, the volume is decreasing as the price is rising, which suggests that the buyers are losing interest and the sellers are gaining control.   Therefore, I think CCJ is due for a correction and I would look for short opportunities below $25. My target would be around $20, which is the previous support level and the 50-day moving average. My stop loss would be above $26, which is the recent swing high and the upper Bollinger band.   This is just my opinion and not financial advice. Please do your own research and trade with caution. Happy trading!",

At time of writing, SPY is about to open for the 11/01/2023 trading day, with Fed action likely to determine immediate direction.   If PA can break above and hold above the red macro support line at 420.18, it could signal an intraday move up to retest 242.77, and with positive fed news, could signal a market appetite for a trend reversal, which would be in keeping with the overall wedge pattern.   Unsubstantiated prediction: SPY could very well break above 420.18, hit its head at 424.77, and range there as it did between Oct 23rd and 25th.  I'll be looking for it to retake the green rising channel to indicate a more bullish trajectory, but for the moment, the green arc pathway similar to PA between the 23rd and 25th is my prediction, completing  a macro Head and Shoulders pattern and setting SPY up for more gains.   Assuming a rejection at 420, SPY is likely to range between 409 and 417 until the market gets a sense of macro-clarity.",

        "text": "On a YTD basis, DraftKings Inc. (Nasdaq: DKNG) is up nearly 145% due to a mix of solid financial results, raising its full-year guidance, and delivering its first quarter of adjusted EBITDA profitability in Q2. With that in mind, the companys Q3 earnings report will drop on November 2nd where I expect it to beat analysts revenue and EPS estimates, all while raising its full-year guidance again. As is, the NFL season is underway which is a seasonal catalyst for the company since Football is the most popular sport for wagers. Now that the company has a clear path toward profitability, DKNG stock could be a smart buy ahead of its Q3 earnings.   DKNG Fundamentals   NFL Season Will Further Improve Performance   DraftKings has done a tremendous job this year growing its market share. According to data from last May, the online sportsbook dominated 32% of the market compared to 27.7% over the year prior. The significance of this growth is that it has been taking market share from its direct competitors.   The sportsbooks biggest competitor is FanDuel which held a 45.1% market share back in May. That said, this figure represents a slight YoY decline from 45.5% which shows that DKNG is a growing force in this market. Other competitors also lost market share as BetMGMs market share shrank from 11.1% to 9.9%, Caesars dropped from 6% to 5%, and Barstools declined from 2.6% to 1.9%.   What is more impressive is that DKNG was able to grow its market share at the same time its sales and marketing costs were declining. In Q2, the sportsbooks sales and marketing costs decreased sequentially to $207.4 million from $389.1 million. At the same time, its revenues increased sequentially from $769.6 million to $874.9 million. The company achieving this feat is impressive considering the lack of highly followed sports events in Q2 except for the NBA playoffs.   With the NFL season underway, DKNG can continue growing its revenues at the same impressive rate due to the popularity of betting on the NFL. A recent survey by the American Gaming Association found that a record 73.5 million Americans plan to place bets on the NFL this season. This figure represents a nearly 60% increase from a year ago which shows how popular betting on the NFL is. As DraftKing holds the second-largest market share in online sports betting, it is safe to assume that a large number of these bettors will place their wagers through the companys platform.   On that note, the first week of the NFL season indicates that the online sports betting industry may be in for a record season. GeoComply  a leading provider of location-based detection technology in the online sports betting industry  recorded 242.3 million geolocation transactions across regulated online sportsbook customers during week 1. This represents a 56% increase from the same period in 2022. Moreover, new research by the AGA found that the first week of the NFL saw 1.1 million new player accounts which is a 40% YoY increase.   The increase in sports betting volume can be due to 3 major markets experiencing their first start to the NFL season which are Maryland, Massachusetts, and Ohio. Across these markets, the new NFL season added 61 thousand new accounts in Maryland, 59 thousand in Massachusetts, as well as a staggering 133 thousand in Ohio.   In light of this, DKNG could stun Wall Street with a strong top-line and bottom-line beat considering that the NFL season started on September 7th. This means that the sportsbook received wagers on 49 games in Q3 spanning the first 3 weeks of the NFL season as well as week 4s Thursday Night Football game.   Q3 Forecast   For its Q3 earnings, analysts expect DKNG to report revenue of $686.3 million and an EPS of -$0.69. That said, the online sportsbook may be poised to shatter these estimates as Im forecasting its revenues to come at $924.9 million and its EPS to be -$0.53.   In the first 2 quarters of 2023, DKNGs revenue increased YoY by 84.48% and 87.68%. As such, Ive used the average YoY increase in the first 2 quarters to project its YoY revenue growth in Q3. Based on an 84.27% YoY increase, the sportsbooks revenue would amount to $924.9 million.   Quarter\tRevenue\tYoY Growth   Q1 22\t$417,205,000\t33.60%   Q2 22\t$466,185,000\t56.65%   Q3 22\t$501,938,000\t135.85%   Q4 22\t$855,133,000\t80.67%   Q1 23\t$769,652,000\t84.48%   Q2 23\t$874,927,000\t87.68%   Q3 23\t$924,940,032\t84.27%   After projecting the companys Q3 revenue, I expect its cost of revenue to be $583.2 million. In the Q2 earnings call, management raised its adjusted gross profit guidance from 42%  45% to 43%  45%. Considering that DKNGs adjusted gross margin was 47% last quarter, I expect it to decline in Q3 in order to reach managements expectations. As such, I used the average gross margin in Q1 and Q2 to reach the figure Im projecting for the cost of revenue.   Quarter\tRevenue\tCost of Revenue\tGross Profit\tGross Margin   Q1 23\t$769,652,000\t$521,740,000\t$247,912,000\t32.21%   Q2 23\t$874,927,000\t$510,323,000\t$364,604,000\t41.67%   Q3 23\t$924,940,032\t$583,251,338\t$341,688,695\t36.94%   As for sales and marketing expenses, there is an apparent trend in the companys financials in the last 2 years of this cost increasing in Q3 compared to Q2. This spike could be due to the company increasing its marketing efforts ahead of the beginning of the NFL season. Based on this trend, I calculated the average Q3 QoQ growth rate in sales and marketing expenses which is 70.3%. At this rate, DKNGs Q3 sales and marketing expenses would be $353.5 million.   Quarter\tSales & Marketing\tQoQ Growth   Q1 21\t$228,686,000   Q2 21\t$170,712,000   Q3 21\t$303,658,000\t77.88%   Q4 21\t$278,444,000   Q1 22\t$321,452,000   Q2 22\t$197,529,000   Q3 22\t$321,714,000\t62.87%   Q4 22\t$345,282,000   Q1 23\t$389,133,000   Q2 23\t$207,487,000   Q3 23\t$353,502,460\t70.37%   Looking at the sportsbooks product and technology costs, we can also find a pattern as the largest QoQ increase occurs in Q1 and is followed by smaller increases. Through this pattern, I calculated the average Q3 QoQ growth rate using data from the last 2 years to reach a projected Q3 growth rate of 1.48%. This would amount to $91.2 million in product and technology expenses.   Quarter\tProduct & Tech\tQoQ Change   Q1 21\t$56,159,000   Q2 21\t$62,635,000\t11.53%   Q3 21\t$65,222,000\t4.13%   Q4 21\t$69,639,000\t6.77%   Q1 22\t$81,352,000\t16.82%   Q2 22\t$77,202,000\t-5.10%   Q3 22\t$76,299,000\t-1.17%   Q4 22\t$83,394,000\t9.30%   Q1 23\t$88,088,000\t5.63%   Q2 23\t$89,906,000\t2.06%   Q3 23\t$91,236,887\t1.48%   The last operating expense remaining on DKNGs income statement is G&A expense. This expense has been declining YoY since Q2 2022. With that in mind, these declines have been at a higher pace since Q4 2022. Therefore, I used the average YoY growth for the first 2 quarters of the year since they are better indicators of the companys current performance. This means that Im projecting G&A expense to decline 26.64% in Q3 which would amount to $136.6 million.   Quarter\tG&A\tYoY Growth   Q1 21\t$168,997,000   Q2 21\t$198,806,000   Q3 21\t$219,706,000   Q4 21\t$240,816,000   Q1 22\t$216,606,000\t28.17%   Q2 22\t$187,609,000\t-5.63%   Q3 22\t$186,261,000\t-15.22%   Q4 22\t$173,244,000\t-28.06%   Q1 23\t$160,476,000\t-25.91%   Q2 23\t$136,256,000\t-27.37%   Q3 23\t$136,635,702\t-26.64%   By subtracting these costs from the projected revenue of $924.9 million, we can estimate DKNGs operating loss to be around $239.6 million.   Revenue\t$924,940,032   Cost of Revenue\t$583,251,338   Sales & Marketing\t$353,502,460   Product & Tech\t$91,236,887   G&A\t$136,635,702   Operating Loss\t-$239,686,354   For the rest of DKNGs expenses, I used the average of the first 2 quarters given that they are better indicators of the companys position at the moment. In this way, Im projecting net interest income, remeasurement of warrant liabilities, other income, income tax provisions, and equity method investments to be $11.9 million, $18.5 million, $32 thousand, $1 million, and $221 thousand, respectively.   Quarter\tNet Interest\tRemeasure. of Warrant Liab.\tOther Income/Expense\tIncome Tax\tEquity Method Inv.   Q1 23\t$11,140,000\t-$17,035,000\t$19,000\t$1,368,000\t$119,000   Q2 23\t$12,745,000\t-$20,041,000\t$45,000\t$651,000\t$323,000   Q3 23\t$11,942,500\t-$18,538,000\t$32,000\t$1,009,500\t$221,000   Adding all of these figures together, we can reach my estimate for DKNGs Q3 net loss of $247.4 million. With more than 463.9 million shares outstanding, this would amount to an EPS of -$0.533  less than analysts estimate of -$0.699.   Revenue\t$924,940,032   Cost of Revenue\t$583,251,338   Sales & Marketing\t$353,502,460   Product & Tech\t$91,236,887   G&A\t$136,635,702   Operating Loss\t-$239,686,354   Net Interest Income\t$11,942,500   Remeasure. of Warrant Liab.\t-$18,538,000   Other Income\t$32,000   Income Tax\t$1,009,500   Equity Method Inv.\t$221,000   Net Loss\t-$247,480,354   OS\t463,974,787   EPS\t-$0.533   Risks   While DKNGs stock outlook appears to be bullish, there is a risk to the bull thesis. With interest rates at multi-decade highs, analysts expect consumer spending to slow down due to several factors including the resumption of student loan repayments, dwindling savings accounts, and banks tightening their lending standards. As such, bettors may reduce their wages in order to save funds which would impact DKNGs revenue growth.   Technical Analysis   Looking at the hourly chart, DKNG stock is in a bearish trend with the stock trading in a downward channel. Looking at the indicators, the stock is below the 200 and 50 MAs which is a bearish sign, however, it recently broke through the 21 MA which could be an indication of a reversal soon. Meanwhile, the RSI is neutral at 49 and the MACD recently had a bearish crossover.   As for the fundamentals, DKNG is set to share its Q3 financial results today, November 2nd, after market close. Considering the success of the early weeks of the NFL season whose impact should be reflected in Q3, the sportsbook may be on track to deliver a strong earnings beat while raising its full-year guidance. With the stock trading near support, bullish investors could find the current PPS a lucrative entry point.   DKNG Forecast   While DKNG stock being up nearly 150% YTD may lead some to believe that its overvalued, this is farther from the truth. The online sportsbook has been performing exceptionally so far this year as seen by its declining costs and growing revenues. With the company releasing its Q3 earnings on November 2nd, I expect it to beat analysts estimates for revenue and EPS for the fourth consecutive quarter while raising its full-year guidance due to the anticipated revenue growth. This growth will be mainly driven by the NFL season which is the most popular sport for bettors. With a clear path toward profitability due to revenue growth and more efficient cost management, DKNG stock could be a profitable long-term investment.",

        "text": "Overview   The Russell is at a potential attractive buy area for long-term investors.   The Details   The Russell (   US2000   ) stock index is in a retrace move. Price is currently between the monthly 50 and 100 SMA's.   Historically, buying when the price is between the moving averages has been a favourable entry area for long-term investments.   Things to Consider   Recession could be on the horizon for the US. This would likely drive prices lower, especially for the Russell 2000.   Using an ETC, such as IWM, is often better for investing in stock indices than futures or OTC products.   Other stock indices may decline further before reaching new highs. The positive correlation between stock indices could bring the US2000 down further.",

        "text": "CHTR   Charter Communications (CHTR) - Trade Plan Update   Trade Setup: Anchored VWAP (AVWAP) Rebound   Rationale:   The initial earnings release day was marked by a distinctly bearish sentiment, with CHTR closing below two critical support levels: the psychological threshold of $375 and the established support at $374.42. Observing the stock's performance into Day 4, there has been a notable turnaround, with CHTR appreciating by 10.05% to $406.51 from a low of $369.38. This recovery and upward momentum indicate a shift in market perception from bearish to bullish, aligning with typical bullish behavior.   Entry Strategy:   The entry point will be identified upon CHTRs retracement to the AVWAP level derived from the earnings release. This price action would indicate a fair value entry, offering a competitive position.   A conditional entry is set to trigger if CHTR tests and subsequently closes above the AVWAP, confirming buyers' control.   An order will be placed using a Buy Stop Limit at an identified intraday high, with the intention of execution on the following trading session.   A Stop Loss will be set below the previous day's intraday low to protect the trade from adverse movements.   Profit Targets:   The primary target is set at a breach above $400, with a subsequent goal of $411.98.   The strategy will be to scale out of the position in stages, securing profits systematically as the targets are achieved.   This trading plan is predicated on the assumption that the bounce off the AVWAP represents a substantial shift in momentum, and the outlined entry and exit parameters are designed to capitalize on this potential upswing while managing risk.",

        "text": "Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) - Revised Trade Strategy   Trade Setup: Anchored VWAP (AVWAP) Reversal Play   Rationale:   Post-earnings, Day 1 concluded with a bearish spinning top despite substantial volume, indicating indecision yet CATs price retained above the critical support level of $225. My initial bias was towards shorting on a potential breakdown below this support. However, the subsequent formation of a highly bullish candle that closed above the high of the previous earnings-related candle has shifted my stance towards a bullish outlook.   Execution Plan:   Monitor the 15-minute chart for a retracement to the AVWAP.   The stock must engage with the AVWAP to confirm its relevance as a dynamic support level.   Absent a touch of the AVWAP, the entry setup is invalidated, and no position will be taken.   A confirmed test of the AVWAP followed by a close above it will signify a shift in momentum to the buyers.   Upon this confirmation, a Limit Stop order will be placed just above a defined intraday resistance level. Concurrently, a Stop Loss will be established beneath an intraday pivot point, which also lies below the AVWAP, to mitigate risk.   Profit Targets:   The initial target is set at $233.72. Upon breaching this level, the next objective will be $240.00.   Half of the position will be exited at a profit level equivalent to 1.5 times the risk assumed from the entry point.   Risk Adjustments:   Continuous evaluation of the trade will occur, and further updates will be disseminated. This strategy, while more nuanced to articulate, is predicated on clear technical confirmations, making it more straightforward to execute in practice than to describe.",

        "text": "In the past 2 months, Cirrus Logic's share price has fallen. This trading idea focuses on buying the stock, as it is expected to have long-term growth potential.   Strategy   The strategy for this trading idea is based on the following factors:   EBIT:   Cirrus Logic's EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) is currently at $34.85. EBIT is calculated by subtracting a company's cost of goods sold (COGS) and its operating expenses from its revenue. A higher EBIT indicates better profitability.   Capital Expenditure:   Positive capital expenditure suggests that a company is investing in its growth and expansion.   Short Term Debt:   Low short term debt indicates lower financial risk and a better ability to meet short-term obligations.   Total Liabilities:   Low total liabilities indicate a healthier balance sheet.   Core Logic   This trading strategy aims to identify companies with long-term growth potential. By considering positive capital expenditure, low short term debt, low total liabilities, and an EBIT per revenue of greater than 23%, the trading idea seeks to find companies that are well-positioned for future growth.   Based on the provided facts, Cirrus Logic meets the criteria for this trading idea. With a current EBIT of $34.85, positive capital expenditure, and a healthy balance sheet, the stock shows potential for long-term growth.   Please note that this trading idea is suitable for investors with a moderately short investment horizon and a very high risk tolerance. As with any investment, it is important to conduct further research and analysis before making any trading decisions.   Technical Outlook   Cirrus Logic (CRUS) bulls are aiming to push the stock past a key resistance level at 60.75 as the next upside milestone if bulls maintain their dominance. Despite strong bullish sentiment, the price action of Cirrus Logic is still focused on testing its lower Bollinger Band at 64.7.   In the most recent trading session, Cirrus Logic's share price appreciated by 1.51%, adding to its three-day uptrend. The stock has recovered almost all of the session losses it suffered yesterday when it dipped down to $66.2.   Cirrus Logic is currently trading with a market cap of $3.72 billion, and 1.15 million shares were traded on the day, above the multiday average of 484,357.   It seems that Cirrus Logic's price action will continue to focus on testing its lower Bollinger Band at 64.7, despite strong bullish sentiment. However, there is a key resistance level at 60.75 that the stock is approaching, now only $1.79 away. A break above this level could open up a new path for further gains in the short-term.   Following today's strong gains and reaching as high as $69.82, extensive multifactorial technical analysis forecasts that Cirrus Logic will extend its strong run further in the short-medium term. With all probabilities considered, the Texan semiconductor supplier is expected to appreciate amid a risk-on mood in the coming days.   Despite strong bullish sentiment in the market, technical analysis classifies Cirrus Logic as a \"Strong Buy.\"",

The TSI is still showing the current trend as continuing. Right now yesterday's candle has settled into the 1st Long Term Support Price Channel and I suspect will remain here and possibly trade flat for several days as the MFI concludes its pattern. I am waiting for a couple of confirmation signals to determine when to buy however for anyone that is holding Tesla Longterm for 5 plus years in your portfolio or wants to add it or accumulate more then at this price level this is worth a serious look. Tesla however is finally at a Price to Sales Ratio that is more in line with it's peers so the price may remain lower through 2024 than the sustained run through 2023 so far. One last note in looking and waiting for a reversal is that a further drop to $186.00 is possible but as I said we need to see a combination of indicators in agreement for a reversal before jumping back in.",

(AMD) stock has been in a downtrend since the beginning of the year. However, in recent weeks, it has formed a double bottom pattern, which is a bullish reversal signal.   A double bottom pattern is formed when a security's price falls to a low, rebounds, falls back to the same low, and then rebounds again. The second rebound is typically accompanied by an increase in volume, which confirms that buyers are gaining control of the market.   In the case of AMD stock, the first bottom was formed in June at around $70 per share. The stock then rebounded to over $80 per share in July, but it fell back to the same low in August. The stock has since rebounded again, and it is now trading above $75 per share.   The double bottom pattern on AMD stock is also supported by a bullish divergence in the MACD indicator. The MACD is a momentum indicator that compares the moving average of a security's closing price to the moving average of its 26-day exponential moving average.   A bullish divergence occurs when the price of a security is making lower lows, but the MACD is making higher lows. This indicates that the momentum of the downtrend is weakening, and that a reversal is likely.   Overall, the technical analysis of AMD stock suggests that a rebound is in the making. The double bottom pattern and the bullish divergence in the MACD indicator are both bullish signals.",

        "text": "Apparently Tesla decided to have the choppiest leading diagonal followed by a micro ending diagonal, then had a very small micro wave 2. To me, this is the only way to count this mess. I did say the other day that a leading diagonal was possible but highly doubtful. Well, it came to fruition so now we track this v down. So far, we have a 1-3 finished and 4 possibly finished or half way done. 5 comes after 4 so we just need one maybe two more lows to finish wave v of (3).   After we bottom in (3) we should start a retrace for wave (4). Until then I cannot give a precise target though as I will use the retracement fib to guide me better. The way I see it now is we will most likely raise to the $217-$220 area before heading down to our final target of (5) of C of 2. After we top in (4) I can give a better target for (5). I believe (4) will be short and shallow though since (2) was long and deep.   Notice on the MACD we are on positive divergence. One or two more lows would set price up nicely for a good retrace. Chart says the rest, let me know if you have questions about it and I will try to get to them as soon as I can.   Bonam Fortunam,   --Tyler",

Our goal is to find a low support point and enter. It can be referred to as buying at the pullback point. The pullback point can be found with a Fibonacci extension of 61.80%. This is a step to find entry level. 1) Find a triangle (Fibonacci Speed Fan Line) that connects the high (resistance) and low (support) points of the stock in progress, where it is continuously expressed as a Slingshot, 2) and create a Fibonacci extension level for the first rising wave from the start point of slingshot pattern.   When the current price goes over 61.80% level , that can be a good entry point, especially if the SMA 100 and 200 curves are gathered together at 61.80%, it is a very good entry point.   As a great help, tradingview provide these Fibonacci speed fan lines and extension levels with ease. So if you use the Fibonacci fan line, the extension level, and the SMA 100/200 curve well, you can find an entry point for the stock market. At least you have to enter at this low point to avoid trading failure, and if you are skilled at entering this low point, with fibonacci6180 technique, your reading skill to chart will be greatly improved.   If you want to do day trading, please set the time frame to 5 minutes or 15 minutes, and you will see many of the low point of rising stocks.   If want to prefer long term range trading, you can set the time frame to 1 hr or 1 day.",

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares leaped more than 9% Wednesday after the company said it expects to sell $2 billion in AI-powered chips next year as it attempts to catch up to market leader and rival Nvidia (NVDA).   The company, which reported better-than-expected third quarter earnings yesterday, is projecting revenue of $6.1 billion (plus or minus $300 million) in the last three months of the year. That number is up from $5.8 billion for the third quarter but below the $6.4 billion analysts had expected.   However, according to some analysts, AMD's lineup of AI processors is more important than its embedded businesschips for industrial, automotive and networking sectors.   AMD is ramping up its investments in artificial intelligence (AI) in an effort to catch up to rival Nvidia, which has become one of the world's biggest semiconductor companies with a market cap exceeding $1 trillion.   AMD's MI300 processor, which the company has described as \"the world's most advanced accelerator for generative AI,\" could help the chipmaker catch up to its bigger rival. Sales of AI-powered graphics processing units (GPUs) are expected to reach $2 billion next year, AMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su said on the company's earnings call.   Su earlier this year called AI \"the defining technology shaping the next generation of computing and the largest strategic growth opportunity for AMD,\" and said the company is \"laser-focused on accelerating the deployment of AI platforms at scale in the data center.\"   Shipments of MI300 processors are expected to begin by the end of 2023, Su said at a product showcase in June.   With Wednesday's gain, shares of AMD are up almost 69% so far this year. While impressive, it's a small gain compared to those of rival Nvidia, which has almost tripled year-to-date and is the S&P 500's best-performing stock this year.",

Results rebound after a bumpy summer   Generac makes power generators for homes and businesses. Given the number of headlines in recent years about massive storms and overwhelming demand stressing the power grid, it should be a great time for a business like Generac, but the company has struggled in recent months.   In August, shares of Generac plunged after the company reported lower revenue and the company cut guidance. The company said at the time that it was dealing with inventory issues and soft demand from consumers, and warned that given the uncertain nature of the economy, it was hard to say how the rest of the year would work out.   Investors got part of that answer on Wednesday when Generac released third-quarter results. The company earned $1.64 per share in the quarter on revenue of $1.07 billion, besting Wall Street expectations for $1.51 per share in earnings on sales of $1.04 billion.   Residential product sales were down 15% year on year, but a 24% uptick in commercial sales helped to offset some of that decline. Generac also saw gross margin rebound to 35.1%, from 33.2% a year ago, on lower raw material costs and streamlined logistics.   Notably, Generac backed its previous guidance for full-year revenue to decline by 10% to 12%. The company also said it expects robust free cash flow in the months to come.   Even with today's gains, Generac shares are still 38% below where they were prior to the August announcement of quarterly results. Indeed, the consumer business is still under pressure. But investors should take solace in hearing that the declines came in as expected.   Investors should be warned that there could be more volatility ahead, but Generac is a leading name in an important category. The concerns about extreme weather and the fragility of the power grid are not going away.   For those with a long-term mindset and the ability to handle near-term headwinds, Generac remains an intriguing pick to capitalize on some of those major energy trends.",

        "text": "I've put a lot of thought into this one. This chart is in log mode as the wide range of prices covered are smoothed and reveal the potential true picture. I give a primary bullish scenario but caveat with multiple different potential outcomes given certain price actions. Trade at your own risk.   As you can see, PLTR put in a significant top near the 61.8% retracement of the major move down from January 2021 to January 2023. In linear mode, it's also a 61.8% retracement (not shown on chart) of the September 2021 top from the January 2023 bottom, further confirming how much of a massive resistance level it is.   Elliot Wave indicates that this was a 3rd wave in a 5-wave upward impulse. For that to be true, PLTR will need to hold the $12 area if it is going to continue down leading into earnings. Should it hold there, the potential for an earnings pop is at our fingertips. If you look at the 2nd wave of the current 5-wave move up, the same thing happened with earnings there leading to a massive move upward into our very explosive 3rd wave.   This leads to our buying opportunity. Should we see PLTR dip below $15 today through Wednesday, October 27th, it would be in the accumulation zone. Set your stop at $12.00 with a GTC-EXT order. This should limit your losses should earnings kickstart a further downward move that breaks support.   Assuming the 5th wave does engage, the potential targets are outlined on the chart. I must caveat though that 5th waves are unpredictable. They can terminate before, at, or higher than the general expected levels. In Elliott Wave, usually only one of the 3 impulse waves (1,3, and 5) will see an extension. With 3rd waves usually targeting the 161.8% fib extension level, the 5th wave target is generally expected to be the 200% level. With every 3rd wave extension level, you can usually expect the 5th wave level to rise the same number of extension levels. In this case, the 3rd wave extended and surpassed the 176.4% level, one extension level above the standard, and came shy of the 200% level. So the general minimum expectation for our 5th wave target should be a minimum of the 223.6% level, which comes in at around $25. Given that the 3rd wave already extended, it should not be expected that the 5th wave will also extend. If it somehow does, the upper target is a gap fill from February on 2021 at $31.34. Profit is generally taken at the minimum level with some runners left for potential upside.   Should PLTR start rising and form an upward pattern prior to hitting my ideal 4th wave target in the mid $12's, it is possible the 4th wave is already in (or maybe it touches the mid $13's one more time). I will add that the shape and structure of a 4th wave that terminates in the $13's holds a far more likely chance of becoming a a descending triangle where the bottom holds flat and the tops terminate lower until the pattern ends. If this were a triangle, it would be most likely that the next touch of the mid $13's would be the c wave with an e wave to come in the $17 range and the e wave to again target the $13's. Due to the nature of the current structure, I only favor a significant earnings pop should PLTR fall to $13 or lower.   Should you see PLTR dip below $12, then the expectation shifts to a major top being in and downward pressure taking this to $10 and potentially lower. Therefore, below $12 range and I recommend getting out and waiting for further clarity. If you hold at a basis higher than the previous top and don't want to sell, consider selling calls to lower your basis or selling $10 puts.   The alternate count not shown on this chart would have the May 2021 low as an A wave, the September 2021 top as a B wave, and the January 2023 bottom as the C wave in a larger degree (A)(B)(C) long term corrective pattern. The recent top at the 61.8% level would be the 3-wave (B) wave of this larger degree, with the bottom (C) wave coming in at new lows over the next 1-2 years. This is why the stop is so important.   Readers should always remember that markets are their own creature made up of millions of individuals and institutions each following some combo of inherent bullishness, inherent bearishness, fundamentals, technicals, stupidity, and pure emotion. Elliott Wave, and specifically Fibonacci Pinball (developed by Avi Gilburt at elliottwavetrader.net and prominent Seeking Alpha author), merely provide a framework based on the observed price action to date. I know that while my wave outline is based on years and years of data and application from not only me, but some of the best in the game, I also know that markets do not follow a set path and that sentiment can remain irrational far longer than I can remain rational. That is why you MUST consider the altneratives and manage risk appropriately. Know the pivot zones that could lead to the primary path failing. In this case, it's the low $12.00 range.

This signifies the covering analysts' collective reconsideration of their initial forecasts over the course of this timeframe.   Prior to a company's earnings release, it is of utmost importance to factor in any revisions made to the earnings projections. These revisions serve as a critical gauge for predicting potential investor behaviors with respect to the stock. Empirical studies consistently reveal a strong link between trends in earnings estimate revisions and the short-term price performance of a stock.   While it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights.   Given this perspective, it's time to examine the average forecasts of specific Apple metrics that are routinely monitored and predicted by Wall Street analysts.   The average prediction of analysts places 'Revenue- Wearables, Home and Accessories' at $9.33 billion. The estimate suggests a change of -3.3% year over year.   The consensus among analysts is that 'Revenue- iPhone' will reach $44.17 billion. The estimate points to a change of +3.6% from the year-ago quarter.   Analysts expect 'Net Sales- Services' to come in at $21.35 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +11.3% from the prior-year quarter.   Based on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Revenue- Mac' should arrive at $8.29 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -28%.   The consensus estimate for 'Net Sales- Products' stands at $67.64 billion. The estimate points to a change of -4.7% from the year-ago quarter.   Analysts predict that the 'Revenue- iPad' will reach $5.86 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -18.4%.   According to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Geographic Revenue- Greater China' should come in at $17.34 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +12.1% from the prior-year quarter.   The collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Geographic Revenue- Europe' of $22.22 billion. The estimate points to a change of -2.5% from the year-ago quarter.   It is projected by analysts that the 'Geographic Revenue- Rest of Asia Pacific' will reach $6.04 billion. The estimate suggests a change of -5.2% year over year.   Analysts forecast 'Geographic Revenue- Japan' to reach $5.52 billion. The estimate points to a change of -3.1% from the year-ago quarter.

With the consensus EPS estimate being $0.54, the EPS surprise was +74.07%.   While investors scrutinize revenue and earnings changes year-over-year and how they compare with Wall Street expectations to determine their next move, some key metrics always offer a more accurate picture of a company's financial health.   Since these metrics play a crucial role in driving the top- and bottom-line numbers, comparing them with the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated about them helps investors better project a stock's price performance.   Here is how Frontdoor performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:   a.

        "text": "The trading value of the 5078 stock tickers traded in the 6088 billion USD.   Hence, the trading value of the top 10 tickers with the highest dollar value of trading was 1811 billion USD, almost 29.75% of all circulated dollars in the market.   The fact that the top 10 tickers account for almost 29.75% of all trading value is a sign of market inefficiency. This suggests that the market is skewed towards a few large tickers. This can lead to increased risk for investors who are trying to exploit market inefficiencies.   The top 10 tickers were:   TSLA: Accounts for more than 7.2% of all trades, 10.3% of S&P500 trades, and 18.98% of NASDAQ100   NVDA: Accounts for more than 6.8% of all trades, 10.3% of S&P500 trades, and 15.27% of NASDAQ100   AAPL   MSFT   AMZN   META   AMD   BRK.A   NFLX   GOOG   The top 10 tickers account for  70.55% of all trading value of tickers on the NASDAQ 100..!   The top 10 tickers account for  38.54% of all trading value of tickers on the S&P500..!   The S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 are both broad market indices that track the performance of the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the United States and the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange, respectively. These indices are widely used by investors as benchmarks for their portfolios.   However, the fact that the top 10 tickers account for such a large share of trading value suggests that these indices may not be as representative of the overall market as they once were. This is because the performance of the top 10 tickers can have a disproportionate impact on the performance of the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100.   The high kurtosis in the distribution of trading values also suggests that the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 may not be as good at capturing the full range of risk and return potential in the market. This is because the distribution of trading values is skewed towards a few large tickers. This means that there is a greater potential for large losses in the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 than would be suggested by their average returns.   As a result of these factors, the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 may be less useful for investors who are looking for a diversified portfolio that is representative of the overall market and that has a low risk of large losses.   Implications   The fact that the top 10 tickers had such a significant impact on the overall trading dollar value has a few implications.   1st: it means that investors who focus on investing in the top 10 tickers are more likely to generate higher returns than investors who invest in a wider range of tickers.   2nd: it means that regulators need to be aware of the potential for market manipulation by investors who have large holdings in the top 10 tickers.   3rd: it means that investors need to be careful not to over-concentrate their portfolios in the top 10 tickers, as this could make them more vulnerable to losses if the performance of these tickers deteriorates.   4th: The correlation between the tickers and indexes may be overstated. This is because the performance of the top 10 tickers has a disproportionate impact on the performance of the indexes. As a result, the correlation between the tickers and indexes may not be representative of the correlation between the individual tickers.   5th: The correlation between the tickers and indexes may be less informative. This is because the correlation between the tickers and indexes does not provide any information about the specific relationships between the individual tickers. For example, the correlation between the tickers and indexes does not tell us whether the individual tickers are moving in the same direction or in opposite directions.   Conclusion:   Even among the top 10 tickers, TSLA and NVDA have dragged too much attention from most market participants, and the Future of the market is very dependent on the future movements of these 2 tickers!   Education:   A fat tail in statistics is a feature of a distribution where the tails of the distribution are thicker than those of a normal distribution. This means that there are more extreme values in the distribution than would be expected under a normal distribution.",

        "text": "Team RED is READY   As with any competitor, a quarterly earnings report from a peer can provide great insight into the market. For Advanced Micro Devices, the Q2'23 earnings report from Intel provides great views on the surging demand for AI chips and a rebound in PC demand crucial for AMD   The most immediate signal from Intel beating Q2'23 estimates and guiding up for Q3 is the rebound in PC demand. Most importantly, the inventory correction appears over with OEMs no longer digesting chip inventory.Back in Q3'22, AMD shocked the market by cutting PC revenue estimates by $1 billion. The company quickly went from $2 billion in quarterly CPU sales for PCs to less than $1 billion.   Intel still reported Q2 Client Computing revenue was down 12% YoY to $6.8 billion, but the number was up $1.0 billion sequentially. The chip giant guided up Q3 revenue to $13.4 billion, up $0.5 billion sequentially.In Q1'23, AMD reported that client revenues had fallen further to only $739 million. AMD CPU revenues are now far over $1 billion per quarter below the peak levels providing substantial upside potential when the PC market normalizes.   Intel discussed a mixed picture for their business in the near term due to AI. The chip giant is seeing a wallet share shift from the sever CPU spend towards AI chips.The move is both good and bad for AMD. The company has the MI300 AI GPU chip hitting the market in Q4 providing a strong competitor to the booming demand for the H100 from Nvidia, but the chip isn't out on the market yet.   In the near term, AMD may see some suppressed data center demand while heading into 2024. Ultimately, the company should see upside from AI demand for the MI300 along with the Alveo AI accelerator.On the Q2'23 earnings call, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger suggested the AI pipeline for 2024 had surged to $1 billion: In my formal remarks, we said we now have over $1 billion of pipeline, 6x in the last quarter.   Going back a few months, Morgan Stanley had estimated the AI potential for AMD was only $400 million with upside potential to $1.2 billion. The Intel forecasts would suggest the AI potential for AMD is far higher next year when the MI300 is in full-scale production.   Nvidia guided up current quarter sales estimates by 50% to over $11 billion. The company suggested data center sales would reach $7+ billion in the quarter.   AMD has only seen data center sales reach $1.3 billion in quarterly sales leaving a huge gap from Nvidia. Even Intel still hit $4.0 billion in data center sales during Q2'23, though the amount is down nearly 20% form 2022 levels due in part to losing market share to AMD.   The big issue for AMD is whether data center sales growth stalls causing a miss to 2H sales targets while booming AI demand ultimately boosts sales starting in Q1'24, or maybe Q4. The chip company peaked at quarterly sales of $6.6 billion back Q2'22 and the current quarterly analyst estimates aren't very aggressive.   A rebound in PC demand to more normalized levels places AMD back at the Q4'23 revenue target of $6.5 billion alone. A PC rebound to normal digestion ($2 billion quarterly run rate) along with higher data center or AI demand leads to vastly higher revenues in 2024.   The current analysts aren't even factoring in much growth in the Q2'24 revenue estimate of $6.76 billion. The amount is just 4% upside from Q2'22 despite potentially surging demand from AMD entering the AI GPU space.   AMD is set to report earrings after the close on August 1. Investors should focus less on the Q2 numbers or even Q3 guidance and focus more on a return to more normalized revenue levels plus the upside from AI.Our view has long held that AMD has the earnings potential of $5 to $6 and the AI opportunity is all upside to this view.   The key investor takeaway is that AMD is still $50 below all time highs while Nvidia has soared over $100 above the late 2021 highs. Investors should use the current weakness in AMD to load up on the stock while leaving some capital to buy any weakness following Q2 earnings due to the potential for near term disappointment leading to long term opportunities.",

        "text": "Shares of visual search and idea platform Pinterest (PINS -1.17%) skyrocketed on hours ago, following the company's third-quarter earnings report. While its stronger-than-expected third-quarter results and robust fourth-quarter revenue guidance were obviously key to the tech stock's big move higher, there was likely more behind the move than the details provided in the earnings release. For instance, investors may want to listen to Pinterest's earnings call to see if there was even more bullish information shared by management during the call.   The call was packed with useful information for investors -- and some good reasons to be bullish. Here are the two must-see takeaways from the call.   1. The advertising market is stabilizing   During times of uncertainty, investors look for management to provide clues that the macroeconomic environment isn't deteriorating. From Pinterest's view, it isn't. Indeed, advertiser demand seems to be stabilizing.   One way this is showing up is the trend the company is seeing in its average price of ads. Though ad prices on its platform were down 12% year over year, this was a huge improvement from 20% year-over-year declines in pricing last quarter. Management said this was driven by a combination of \"industrywide demand stabilization\" and the company's artificial intelligence-driven efficiencies gained across its ad stack during the quarter.   2. AI is becoming integral to Pinterest's business   One of the most repeated keywords during the call was artificial intelligence (AI).   \"We continue to use AI to improve the relevance and personalization of our content recommendations and satisfy user intent on our platform through improved shopping experiences,\" said Ready.   In one example of how Pinterest is using AI, it's pairing it with large language models \"to more precisely link product metadata to user queries to show ads that are visually and contextually relevant,\" Ready said. Doing this \"drove meaningful improvements across cost per click and cost per action and better ads relevance.\"   With Ready calling AI a \"great source of strength\" for the company, investors should expect Pinterest to continue investing in it. Fortunately, it looks like it's already additive to the company's business performance; so shareholders are in the fortunate position of being able to see results from these investments quickly.   Pinterest's momentum in AI, a stabilization in advertiser demand, and its improving differentiation as a place for a unique and seamless shopping experience position the company well for a potentially solid fourth quarter and a strong 2024. With momentum like this, Pinterest's top-line growth could continue accelerating.   No wonder shares surged higher this week.",

        "text": "Welcome to the final instalment of our Day Trader's Toolbox series, in which we highlight some essential tools and indicators which have the potential to transform your day trading.   Today we lift the lid on the   Average True Range or ATR    a simple yet highly effective tool when analysing the price movement of any market. Well explain how ATR helps you to view the market through the eyes of a professional trader and well outline the three core uses for ATR in day trading.   I. Understanding ATR:   What is ATR?   Okay, lets start with the basics: ATR is designed to measure market volatility by calculating the average range between the high and low prices over a specific period.   Without delving into the ATR formula, it's important to understand that this indicator takes price gaps into account. This factor provides traders with an authentic representation of market volatility.   On TradingView, the ATR indicator appears as a line underneath your chart. And whilst it can be calculated on any timeframe, we typically talk about ATR in terms of the daily timeframe  hence ATR will tell us how much we can expect a stock to move up or down in typical trading day.   Daily ATR on Daily Candle Chart   Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results   Start Seeing Price Movement Like a Seasoned Trader   Have you ever found yourself drawn to the lists of top gainers and losers on stock trading platforms? It's a common fascination for novice traders, as these lists provide quick summaries of what's \"hot\" on any given day.   However, seasoned traders know that evaluating stock prices solely based on percentage movements is about as practical as a paper umbrella in a rainstorm.   To illustrate this point, consider two stocks, Stock A and Stock B, both opening with a 3% increase. Yet, Stock A typically fluctuates by 3% on an average day, while Stock B usually moves by 1.5%. In this context, Stock B's price movement is far more significant.   This is where ATR comes into play. ATR normalises market price movements, making it a valuable tool for comparing a stock's price changes against its historical performance and its peer group.   So, it's time to shift your perspective. Leave behind the world of percentage-based analysis and adopt ATR to see price movement through the eyes of a professional trader.   II. 3 Ways to Use ATR When Day Trading   1. Profit Targets   Consider this day trading scenario: The market has broken above its previous day's high (PDH), and the price is showing signs of consolidation while staying above VWAP. With these clear signals of strength and insights from your higher timeframe analysis, you decide to go long. Now, the question is, where do you place your profit target?   Answer:   As a day trader, your goal is to capitalise on intraday price movements and avoid holding positions overnight, thereby mitigating overnight risks. This means that setting a structural target, such as the next resistance level, may not be practical.   However, if you incorporate the daily ATR with the current day's low, it provides you with an exceptionally realistic profit target. This target is entirely objective and calibrated to the specific market's current level of volatility.   It's important to note that ATR is an average, so it should be used as a guide rather than an absolute rule. Nevertheless, having a tool to adjust your profit expectations is invaluable, especially in the emotionally charged environment of day trading.   Example:   ATR based profit target   Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results   2. Stop Placement   In swing trading, where positions are held over several trading sessions to capture price swings, using multiples of the ATR for stop placement is a smart strategy. It helps keep your stops outside of market noise and enhances risk management.   However, when it comes to day trading, it's understandable that stops need to be considerably smaller. But that doesn't mean we can't use ATR to fine-tune our stop loss levels according to market volatility.   Day traders can benefit from using a multiple of a lower timeframe ATR to establish a volatility-adjusted stop loss. This approach is often more effective than simply placing a stop below the nearest level of support. For day traders using a 5-minute candle chart, a stop set at 10 times the ATR on this timeframe is a reasonable starting point.   Keep in mind that ATR serves as a normaliser of price movement across different markets. Using ATR for stop placement allows for consistency in risk management across the various markets you trade.   For day traders who prefer locking in profits as a trade moves in their favour, an ATR trailing stop can be an invaluable tool. It trails the stop a certain number of ATRs below the close of a specified number of bars, dynamically adjusting to the market's volatility. TradingView offers numerous ATR trailing stop indicators just search for ATR Trailing Stop in the indicators tab.   Example:   ATR Trailing Stop Loss   Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results   3. Measuring Overextension   Just as ATR proves invaluable in setting realistic profit targets calibrated to market volatility, it also serves as an objective measure to define when a market is overextended.   There are various methods to use ATR for this purpose, but one of the most straightforward approaches involves Keltner Channels, which envelop an ATR band on either side of an exponential moving average.   When the price moves beyond the boundaries of the Keltner Channels, it is considered overextended. Day traders can experiment with Keltner Channel settings. The standard setup involves using 2.5 times the ATR wrapped around a 20-period exponential moving average. Wider bands (a higher ATR multiplier) across a longer period of the moving average generate fewer signals, while narrower bands across a shorter period produce more signals.   Incorporating Keltner Channels, in conjunction with support and resistance levels, provides an additional layer of confirmation for day traders, enhancing their ability to assess overextension in the market.   Example:   Keltner Channels: S&P 500 5min Candle Chart   Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results   In summary, ATR is a versatile tool for day traders, helping them navigate volatile markets with precision. It aids in setting realistic profit targets, fine-tuning stop placement, and identifying market overextension. By incorporating ATR into your trading strategy, you can make informed decisions and manage risk more effectively.   Disclaimer: This is for information and learning purposes only.

        "text": "Introduction   Things are looking spooky after the constant rise of bond prices, with the 10-year yield hitting 5% this week, the highest level since 2007. We'll go over how these important patterns are playing out all over again. This is without a doubt a very scary time for the stock market, with rumors of a recession from earlier this year. Should we be worried? As we talked about last week,   LMT   was a ticker we were observing as the Israel and Palestine conflict continued to see how it would affect prices, now we are looking at how the overall stock market is affected. Let's dive in.   *For a quick overview, please reach the end of the page for the analysis conclusion.   SPY   1H Chart (Inverted)   FRVP: Oooo just look at how the Elliot wave hit the line perfectly on the FRVP, we're going to keep an eye out on any important volume areas and see where things consolidate and stay in place, which is what I'm predicting coming the next few weeks, for things to be horizontal. Usually in these areas, we see that they can play as a level of resistance so we'll see.   Elliot Waves: I believe we are now on an upward trajectory, after the (12345) we should of course according to Elliot wave theory, follow up with an (ABC). We can see when we bring indicators into the mix how this may be a likely scenario, but of course, there are still many other scenarios to consider., this is as close as I can get to predicting what happens next.   Fib Retracement: The retracement is there to see the likely spot of the (B) wave, this is just an estimate and may not hit perfectly but it's there just in case.   MACD: We are now showing   bullish divergence on the MACD   which is what we want to see in this case if we want the Elliot wave to play out.   RSI: After hitting oversold in September, then again later in October, there is a very high chance for   upside in the market   , especially after a long while of bearish behavior. Not only all that but we have just broken through the 60.00 level, which shows that we may be in a bullish move now. If you are wondering why I wrote still oversold its because at the time of making the chart I did not expect it to hit the   60.00   level just yet.   SPY   D Chart   Fib Retracement:   SPY   Struggles to continue higher through retracement levels, although hope should not be lost, we are now entering what seems to be a consolidation period before either a   big move down   or   big move up   , all depends how everyone is feeling about the stock market, fed, bonds, inflation, etc. As long as 0.5 plays as some sort of support, we should be in a bull market   Moving Average: 200 D is just there to see historic price action and levels of support/ resistance, not much information I gathered on it, it's just there.   MACD: Looks like we're nearing the end of this short, no cross as of yet.   Stock RSI: You see it, we have a cross yet nothing to be excited about still have time for things to play out.   FRVP: Wow who could have guessed, the FRVP plays a support level. Let's see what happens in the coming days.   Elliot Waves: Do you spot the pattern? I sure do. We see   similar historic behavior   fold before our eyes. Back in 2021, we had a full Elliot wave pattern play out the same way it's doing now, but only smaller. Will this play out? From our indicators and trend analysis it seems likely.   RSI: Not sure about the Elliot waves? It's okay that's fair, tell you what, I put a possible play that could happen in the RSI that could help us see if this will play out appropriately.   SPY   1W Chart   *Put the   DXY   to show how history has played out between the US dollar and stock market, obviously they are inverse of each other.   Conclusion   We are in a difficult situation with bonds, inflation, oil prices, and other worldly factors that can impact the market. But I have faith that we are just in a fear phase and it will soon pass. This is what I call a   buy opportunity.

This decline reflects the complex dynamics between company performance and investor expectations.   The stock found support at $359 after a 14% drop from its September 2023 peak, where it failed to break the $420 mark.   Over the last decade, Mastercard's stock has grown by 428%, but since April 2021, its growth has slowed, with the stock oscillating between $276 and $420. Despite these fluctuations, the overall trend remains bullish.   Currently, Mastercard's stock is up 7% for the year, showcasing resilience amid market volatility.

When we look at the Weekly chart, we see a   nice Head and Shoulders formation   in the making. Points to consider if taking this opportunity:   1. I will be waiting for NVDA to drop below $400 mark, to be more precise, $398. I need this down pump for the entry to be valid.   2. When the play starts, I will set   my SL   close to $411 level. Why there you may ask? If the drop in price happens, $411 will be the level where 10EMA will be on the Daily time frame, and since this will be a short sell, I don't want to give the market the opportunity to test the higher part of the Neckline. The Neckline of the Head and Shoulders will be my exit point, if the price breaks above the neckline, I will most likely be closing the trade manually.   3. For the   TP level   , I am looking at couple of possibilities. First one, is the entire length from the Head to the Neckline which is in range of some $100 price movement. The second possibility, the more conservative one, will be the previous Higher High of the movement, sitting around $346.61 price level which is also where the 200EMA is currently at. The third one, is of course the 200EMA itself. As the price keeps moving, it will move as well, and if there is no strong market movement and price makes the second guess on whether or not it will go down, the 200EMA will be my \"get out quick\" point.   Of course, as always, this is no financial advice. This is just my humble opinion.",

        "text": "Intel Corporation (INTC) has been trading within a Channel Up throughout the whole year and as you can see on the chart, the pressure points are best displayed with the use of the Fibonacci Channel levels. Last Thursday's bottom on the Higher Lows trend-line couldn't have come at a stronger demand level, as it hit (and immediately rebounded on) the 1D MA200 (orange trend-line).   The price even broke and closed above the 1D MA50 (blue trend-line) yesterday and more importantly completed the first 1D MACD Bullish Cross below 0.0 since August 30. It is a similar rebound sequence where again the price was just above the 1D MA50 and eventually completed a +25.24% rise, marginally above the 1.382 Fibonacci horizontal extension. Every time the 1D MACD formed a Bullish Cross below 0.0 within this Channel Up, we had the same bullish confirmation signal and the stock rose by +25.24%, +38.83%, +36.47% on those occasions, always hitting at least the 1.382 horizontal Fib level.   As a result, we expect the stock to complete the 'minimum' +25.20% fractal rise, thus we target $40.00 on the short-term and on the long-term, extend to at least $43.00, which is the 1.382 Fibonacci extension and would make an optimal technical Higher High on the 2023 Channel Up.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------   ** Please LIKE , FOLLOW , SHARE  and COMMENT  if you enjoy this idea!

        "text": "Not all is equal. And nothing is static.   Entropy is the foundation of our world, and it is the bane of a rich man's existence.   You collect in one spot, then nature comes up and spreads your work around.   Entropy is the unbeatable power of justice. In the end entropy always wins.   One has limited amount of time to temporary evade it.   Panta Rhei - Heraclitus   Everything flows. Money just like water, tends to move around. It is what it is meant to do.   Rich men need poor ones to collect from. In the end, there is nothing else to collect from the poorer ones. But the cycle must continue. No rich man could ever possibly give out wealth for free. Instead, they let nature do its trick and rebalance things.   I will now try to make a rough model of the changes in markets. Divide markets in distinct periods so as to have a better understanding on the progress of a bull market.   Energy Conservation   Money and entropy tend to spread out. When the stock market was \"invented\", few had the stocks and many had the money. Trading is a way to manipulate entropy to our advantage. We let nature spread what we don't need, and as a repayment we accumulate what we need. The stock market is like a   free energy machine   .   The invention of the stock market resulted in a massive wealth transfer, and ended with a painful crash; The Great Depression. The peak of the Roaring '20s was the peak of wealth accumulation from the few.   In the post-Great-Depression economy, money spread out again. From the few to the many.   In these decades, DJI (the big 30) stagnated while SPX (the 500) progressively got stronger.   But the big-30 had an ace up their sleve.   In trading the game must always go on. There is always a way to get richer.   And so, commodities became the new place for wealth to accumulate to.   From all of the above we have come to realize that bubble tops come when the few have accumulated the maximum possible from the many. DJI/SPX measures oligarchy, while the inverse SPX/DJI measures democracy in the spread of wealth in stocks.   Many bubbles and many crashes have followed after the Great Depression. The .com bubble crash and the GFC are memorable to young and old alike. And they all exhibit the same base structure. It is all the same, with one crucial difference.   The 2020 economy is vastly different from the 1920 economy.   The role of SPX and DJI has changed in the last few decades. DJI used to represent the companies that shaped bubbles and SPX the ones that followed. Now NDX and SPX are the indices that represent fast growth while DJI has taken the role of the \"index of stability\".   The modern balance-of-power measure is the following:   SPX-equal-weight divided by SPX-market-cap.   www.tradingview.com/...ven-off-at-the-pass/   Since I couldn't find an SPX-equal-weight index in TradingView, I have constructed a similar chart using two ETFs, RSP and IVV. The RSP/IVV chart is a good analogue to the standard chart.   And so, where do we conclude?   After much analysis we can say the following in retrospect.   The 2008 bubble was quick but with big repercussions.   Money democracy shows signs of impeding financial weakness.   And as for the post-2009 Bull Market...   We realize that it progressively turns into a bubble. While there is no definitive way to \"normalize\" SPX, SPX/M2SL proves a good candidate for absolute SPX cost.   Yield rates tell many tales.   Usually yield rates increase as the wide economy needs them. Strong economies need a lot of money and they can withstand high yield rates. And contrary to popular belief, yield rates are   positively   correlated with yield rates. Now however, the wide economy refuses to absorb such high yield rates. High production cost and high rates can destabilize the economy.   Money Democracy is Positively Correlated to Yield Rates.   Now we witness the wide economy refuse to absorb these yields.   This has resulted in unprecedented wealth accumulation from the few.   Speculation Chart:   While this type of analysis is subjective, it is interesting to see patterns repeat.   Composite Chart:   An experimental chart attempts to calculate the scale of the derivative bubble we are in.   We realize that equity prices are now lying. They are simply too inflated and riddled with derivatives to believe in.   All of that was quite complex to follow through, and even harder to make a conclusion.   In the end, the simplest analysis might be the best.   A massive bearish upward channel has formed. Now price has rejected once again off the ceiling. The real recession may have not even started yet...   Tread lightly, for this is hallowed ground.   -Father Grigori   Bonus Charts:   Have we reached a golden ceiling?",

        "text": "Overview   Applovin Corporation (APP) is a stock that has shown significant price appreciation over the past three months. With a trading volume that rose to 51% of its average daily volume in the previous session and a year-to-date price movement of 115%, APP presents an attractive opportunity for investors.   Strategy   This trading idea focuses on selecting stocks that have demonstrated strong price appreciation and high trading volume. By identifying assets that have performed well in the market and are actively traded, there is a potential for substantial returns.   Logic   The core logic behind this strategy is to take advantage of the positive market sentiment surrounding APP. The stock has shown consistent growth over the past three months, indicating strong investor interest. Additionally, the increased trading volume in the previous session suggests that there is heightened activity around APP, further reinforcing its potential for growth.   Technical Outlook   It appears that Applovin (APP) is closing in on a key support level at $34.63, with the stock approximately 40 cents away from testing this level. Dropping below this support level could indicate further losses ahead, while failing to break below it may be viewed positively by bulls, with a retracement likely.   Applovin's price action is also nearing a key Bollinger Band level of $35.27, following bearish price action and heavy selling. This could further add to the pressure on the stock.   In today's session, Applovin's downtrend continued as the stock shedded 29 cents or 0.79%. Yesterday, the stock closed at 36.44, with a range between 36.27 and $37.28, showing no clear direction.   Despite the recent downturn, Applovin has outperformed the Nasdaq by 117.91% this year and currently has a market cap of $12.67 billion. However, trading volume was 51% lower than average yesterday, indicating a lack of strong market interest.   Overall, based on technical analysis, Applovin is currently rated a 'Strong Buy' despite the bearish market mood. Investors should closely monitor the stock's movement as it approaches the key support level and Bollinger Band level.   Other themed assets that saw positive movement yesterday include Intel, which increased to 36.50 from 35.69, ServiceNow with a 2.34% gain, and Accenture plc Class A (Ireland) with a 1.5% increase.   Conclusion   Based on the provided facts, the trading idea is to buy Applovin Corporation (APP). This asset has exhibited significant price appreciation and has attracted high trading volume, making it an attractive investment opportunity. However, it is important to note that this strategy requires a moderately short investment horizon and a high risk tolerance, as the price volatility of the stock may result in potential losses.",

        "text": "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) is a stock that has seen an appreciation in its stock price since the beginning of the year. This trading idea focuses on the company's financial performance and its potential for future growth.   Key Metrics:   Gross Profit Ratio:   Regeneron's gross profit ratio currently stands at 87.18%. This metric measures the efficiency and effectiveness of the company by dividing its gross profit by its total net sales.   Research and Development (R&D) Expenditures:   Regeneron invests $1 billion annually in R&D. This indicates the company's commitment to innovation and the development of new products.   EBITDA:   The company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) is currently $1.20 billion. This metric provides insights into the company's operating performance.   Debt Ratio:   Regeneron's debt ratio, which is the ratio of total debts to total assets, stands at 8.81. This indicates a relatively low level of debt compared to its assets.   Trading Strategy:   This trading idea focuses on companies with a moderate investment horizon and a somewhat high risk tolerance. The strategy is to buy the asset, REGN.   Idea Core Logic:   This strategy looks for companies that have a high gross profit ratio, indicating efficient and effective performance. It also focuses on companies that invest significantly in R&D, as this suggests a commitment to innovation and future growth. Additionally, companies with a high EBITDA and a low debt ratio are preferred, as they indicate strong financial performance and a healthy balance sheet.   In the case of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, it meets all these criteria with a gross profit ratio of 87.18%, 1 billion annual R&D expenditures, 1.20 billion EBITDA, and a debt ratio of 8.81. These factors suggest that Regeneron has a strong financial position and potential for future growth, making it an attractive investment opportunity.   Technical Outlook   Regeneron (REGN) bulls are looking to push the stock past a key resistance level at $759.49 as the next upside milestone if bulls maintain their dominance. Technical analysis indicates that a strong downtrend may be forthcoming with short positions being favored when the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) falls below -100.   In today's session, Regeneron continued its 12-day uptrend by gaining 0.29%. The stock climbed to $779.89, showing positive momentum.   In terms of returns, Regeneron has outperformed the Nasdaq by 0.88% so far this year. It currently has a market cap of $83.25 billion.   There were 382,219 shares traded on the day, slightly below the average daily volume of 392,139 shares.   Regeneron recently released its earnings figures, reporting 3.16 billion in revenue and earnings per share of 10.24. Market analysts had forecasted revenues of 3 billion and an EPS of 9.92. For the next earnings report, Regeneron is expected to announce revenues of 3.22 billion and an EPS of 10.8.   Technical analysis indicates a possible new, strong downtrend for Regeneron. The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) indicator is below -100, suggesting that the market price is unusually low and below its moving average. A bullish engulfing candlestick pattern has also appeared on Regeneron's price chart.",

        "text": "If you are interested in quantitative trading (quant trading) or even if youre only interested in investing, chances are you may have heard of arbitrage, co-integration and pairs trading. But chances are equally likely you have no idea what these truly mean and how to assess/measure and exploit these different concepts in your trading life and investment life. And it makes sense, these are really complex concepts and generally utilized by quantitative traders in institutional trading. But, why let them have all the fun. So Im going to try to simplify these concepts and give you a working idea of:   a) What these things mean;   b)\tWhy they are imported for traders and investors; and   c) How to start applying these concepts to your trading and/or investment portfolio.   First, lets get started with the pesky definition details.   Arbitrage: Isnt that a big bird?!   In finance, arbitrage generally refers to any short to mid term trading strategies that revolve around mean reversion models and the exploitation of pricing inefficiencies. Despite the fact that the    Efficient market Hypothesis    postulates that markets are efficient and thus unpredictable, I am going to show you that they are in fact very inefficient and all it takes is a little math to reveal these inefficiencies.   And Co-Integration?   Co-integration is kind of like co-habitation, perhaps more copulation. If two tickers were going to have a child together, it would be a co-integration. Essentially, co-integration refers to what a ticker would look like while integrated into another ticker. The official explanation of cointegration is essentially when two or more nonstationary time series move together in such a way that their linear combination results in a stationary time series. Now this is the involves modelling one ticker after another, so that you can essentially predict one tickers price or behaviour, from another.   It may help to show you some examples of co-integration via charts. So lets take a look at some examples below, using the   SPTS indicator   to perform linear regression assessments:   In the chart above, I have placed a co-integration model of GOOG and MSFT through linear regression. Essentially, we use GOOGs close price to calculate the respective fair value of MSFT. From this, we can see when MSFT is over-valued from GOOG and vice versa, and we can see when the two are fully integrated (a regression to the mean).   Now cointegration isnt a natural order. Not everything can co-integrate. Sometimes, there just isnt a significant relationship. For this, we must apply some statistical tests. There are many that can be used, such as the Engle Granger Test, but the most popular is the Dickey Fuller test or Augmented Dickey Fuller test. We will talk more about this later.   Pairs Trading   Pairs trading refers to trading both arbitrage and co-integration. Remember our GOOG/MSFT example above? Well, pairs trading involves assessing, modelling and trading this co-integrated relationship. Let me explain through charts:   In the chart above we can see both MSFT and GOOG are in an uptrend. However, MSFT is lagging below GOOG and GOOG is holding slightly above MSFT. Now, because they are both in an uptrend, you dont want to short, but if you wanted to maximize your profits, you are going to long the stock that is under-performing its benchmark or cointegrated pair, i.e. GOOG.   We can see this translated into about a 6.18% gain on MSFT vs only a 4.75% gain had you longed GOOG.   Now, traditional pairs trading generally involves finding two stocks that are highly correlated but have extremely diverged, shorting the one that is overvalued and longing the one that is undervalued. But I can tell you, that is almost IMPOSSIBLE to find in the real world! So I settle for this as a pseudo-pairs trading fill in!   Here is an intra-day example between SPY and QQQ from Tuesday October 31st:   Do you notice anything in this chart?   During the morning sell down, SPY lagged QQQ and QQQ sold more starkly. SPY held higher above QQQ, which we can see from our co-integration model. So what would have made more sense, to long SPY or QQQ for the bounce?   If you said QQQ, you are correct:   From its lowest to highest point, SPY bounced 0.57%.   From its lowest to highest point, QQQ bounced 0.85%.   And we were able to see that QQQ had more upside room than SPY by looking at the co-integration model overlaid on the chart.   Now do you remember when I talked about arbitrage and how I said the market isnt so efficient when you pull in these pesky math equations? This is why. There is arbitrage everywhere, everyday, on every stock. These small inconsistencies in pricing that can be exploited for profit. Now, as retail traders, we likely dont have the computing and modelling power/setup necessary to scan millions of tickers, creating multiple co-integration models to look for these pricing anomalies and capitalize on them, but we can absolutely have our own co-integration model built on stocks that we trade frequently, or that we like to invest in.   But before we get into the how, lets look at some different examples of co-integration and mean reversion. First, lets look at an example of a perfect integration i.e. the same stock with SPY and SPX:   You can see that the blue lines align perfectly with the candles. But watch what happens when we overlay SPY and ES1! (the futures version):   Do you notice something..   strange   ?   Despite ES1! And SPY being pretty identical, we can notice a few drifts or inconsistencies in the pricing. This is likely attributable to the extended trading time of ES1! Vs SPY which is limited in its trading times, but it does highlight how these inconsistencies can pop up on tickers/futures that are trading almost identical underlying assets (in this case, the S&P 500).   What about investments? How is this useful for investments?   This is actually a really great question and.. well friends Im going to show you how your investments can thrive with a little bit of quantitative love!   Lets use a very straight forward example, SPY and QQQ. They are pretty similar, tend to follow each other. Over the past 75 days, SPY and QQQ have a Pearson Correlation of 0.94. That is a pretty substantial relationship!   If we look at what SPY looks like overlaid with QQQ, here we are:   In the chart above, you can see there are areas where SPY outperforms QQQ and QQQ outperforms SPY. If we were to export SPY and QQQ trading data since July 2020 into Excel and create a investment model based on the modelled relationship between SPY and QQQ, it would look something like this:   Column B has our SPY close Price, C our QQQ close price, E through G are how we calculate the Dickey Fuller statistic, H and I are our SPY and QQQ Returns respectively, and J is our investment of $100.   Now, if we create a SPY trading algorithm off this model and tell it to long and hold SPY as long as it is undervalued in comparison to QQQ, sell when its over-valued and re-buy when its undervalued, assuming an initial investment of 100$, between July 22nd, 2020 and October 31st, 2023, you would have made exactly $36.40 or 36%. Had you just held SPY for that time and not sold when SPY became over-valued against QQQ, you would have made $27.95, or around 28%. The difference seems marginal maybe, but it is quite a stark percent difference.   And if you change that 100 to, say, 10,000, the difference starts to add up.   So  How can do you do it?   So now for the technical stuff. I am going to try to keep this as easy and straight forward as possible.   In a nutshell, the steps involved in developing a co-integration model include the following:   a) Finding a rational basis for the integration: It is insufficient to think that one stock should relate to the other. You need a rationale basis as to why these stocks are similar, which can later be confirmed by some tests.   b)\tReference a correlation table or matrix to compare the stocks of interest and identify the highest correlated stock pairs.   c)\tOnce you have identified the highest correlated stock pairs, you can use an indicator such as   SPTS   to create a regression model, or you can use Excel to create a regression model (for simplicity, I am going to show you how to do it on the SPTS indicator).   d)          Create your co-integration model in Excel by exporting your two stocks of interest and plotting in your linear regression formula.   e)\tPerform the Dickey Fuller test to ensure stationarity.   f)\t         Youre done!   Now, lets walk through the steps, using NVDA and SMH as our two basis.   Determine rationality:   NVDA is a subsector of chips, which is tracked by SMH.   Check Correlation:   We can see on this correlation matrix, NVDA has a 0.82 correlation to SMH. It is the strongest, even stronger than QQQ which has a 0.74 correlation. In general, you want a correlation >= 0.8. So SMH has passed the first and second step!   Create a Regression Model   For simplicity, lets use SPTS.   Launching SPTS, it is going to ask us to set a start and end time. I am going to start from the beginning of 2018 till current (approx. 5 years). Then, in the settings, I am going to select Linear Regression   SPTS is going to output a linear regression model (green arrow):   We are going to take a look at the Significance or P value, which is 0.9, even better than our correlation matrix result! And our R squared which is 0.8. This is an excellent R2 reading! We generally will accept R2 of 0.5 or greater, so 0.8 is perfect! We can also see our Error is 138.59, which means the variance present between NVDA and SMH is around $138.59 in both directions.   The meat of our model is the equation y = 2.7994x + -114.15. We need this formula for the next step.   Export the data into Excel   We are going to click the dropdown menu in the top right hand corner by our chart title and click    Export chart data   :   We are going to do this for both our tickers.   Once we have the data, we are going to just leave the Time and the Close price for NVDA and copy over the close price for SMH so that our Excel file looks like this:   Now, we are going to create a column in D called Co-Integration. In this column, we are going to use our model equation that was generated by SPTS like so:   Remember, we are converting SMH to NVDA, so we take the SMH close price and substitute for X in the equation.   Once that is done, we can drag and drop the data to calculate the expected close for NVDA:   If we want to use Excel to calculate the equation, we can select an empty cell and use the formula =SLOPE(known ys (NVDA), Known_xs (SMH)):   Then, in another column, we use =INTERCEPT(known_ys (NVDA), known_xs (SMH)):   Perform Dickey Fuller Test   So now we have our data, we have to ensure there is stationarity. Stationarity refers to the principle that the statistical processes of a stock will remain the same. Stationarity is required for any time series analysis, without stationarity, time series would not work in the way we need it to for this.   Now dont get confused by the term. Stationarity doesnt mean that the stock price cant change, just that its statistical attributes will remain the same. For example, say NVDA and SMH both gain 4% in one day, then following day they lose 2%. Now, say in two months, both gain 4.2% and lose 2.2% the next day. This is a simplistic example of stationarity. The statistical processes that are driving these two tickers remain constant, despite the price increase or decrease.   So to perform a stationarity analysis, we need to first do what is called Differencing. All this means, is we need to subtract NVDA from our Co-integration formula like so:   Then we drag down. (Notice we assigned this column X. This is for simplicity).   One thing you will notice is the value of X is negative. This implies that NVDA is actually OVERVALUED in comparison to SMH. We are going to be seeing a lot of negatives ;).   Now that we have created our X column, we can go ahead and calculate what is called delta x or x change. This is the difference between the second and first x value, calculated as such:   We simply subtracted the proceeding value from the previous value. Once we put in the formula once we can just drag and drop it:   Now the last thing we need to do is created a lagged value of X. This is because the Dickey Fuller test requires lagged values to assess stationarity. So we simply carry down the previous X like so:   Then what do you think?..... we drag and drop :p.   So now we are ready to calculate the Dickey Fuller result. And this is actually really easy! All we do is use the formula =LINEST(known_ys, known_xs). Our known Ys are going to be the delta x and our known xs are going to be the lagged x.   But before we use this function, we are going to highlight 2 rows like so:   The top called coefficient and the bottom error. This will give us the regression coefficient (the same thing we multiplied our SMH value by), as well as the standard error. Once we have our two boxes highlighted, we will put in our command like so:   NOW BEFORE YOU PRESS ENTER!   You need to force the LINEST function to only print the two values we want, so to do this, after we put in our known Ys and Known Xs, we are going to use the comma , and put 0 then comma , and put 1. This is going to tell Excel we want a negative coefficient (for the DF test) and to print our standard Error:   Then, we are going to press ctrl + shift + enter. Or command + shift + enter on a mac. This is going to force Excel to only print the two variables of interesting:   And there are our results! Now, to calculate the DF test, all we do is divide the coefficient by the error like so:   And here is the result:   So what does it mean? Well, there are 3 critical values on Dickey Fuller   T Critical at 10% confidence = -1.75   T Critical at 5% = - 1.616   T Critical at 1% = -2.567   To be significant, the t-statistic needs to be below a critical value.   As a vague rule of thumb, in general, the more negative a value is, the more confident we are to reject the null hypothesis, that the data is NOT stationary. Here, we fail to have a very negative value and we fail to come in lower than any of the critical values. As such, we have to accept the null hypothesis and the fact that this data is non-stationary.   If we take, by comparison, the t-statistic of SPY and QQQ since 2020, it is a value of -2.048 within a normal distribution. Thus, we can say that the data is stationary up until a confidence level of 5%. However it is not significant within a 1% confidence level.   A side note on distribution:   While the distribution type does not technically affect the DF results, we should pay attention to whether we are operating with a normal distribution or an abnormal distribution.   So we need to check the distribution, which we can do with SPTS:   So should we accept NVDA and SMH as stationary?   No. Unfortunately, it is not a stationary dataset and we cannot use SMH to determine the fair market value of NVDA. I wanted to use this example to show you that stationarity is not a rule and it can be a challenge ascertain it in your models. But if you are big into the indices, generally you will find stationarity if you are looking between 3 to 4 years back max.   To recap, stationarity depends on   a)\tThe distribution type (a normal distribution should be ABOVE the critical values and a non-normal distribution should be below the critical values).   b)\tIn both cases, the more negative a value is, the stronger we can reject the null hypothesis. For example, if we returned a value of -4 on a normal distribution, this would indicate strong evidence of stationarity and would create an extremely reliable model.   c)\tIf the data distribution is non-normal, we need the value to fall below the critical values. So, for -1.75, we would need the value to be less that -1.75 for 10% confidence, less than -1.61 for 5%, etc.   That said, I went ahead and applied the algo despite nonstationary data, to see how it would have faired using SMH as its anchor point. The initial investment was $200 at the start of 2018 and it would only buy NVDA when the value of NVDA fell below the FMV based on SMH. The result?   Our $200 would be $734.85 as of today, assuming we bought when NVDA was below FMV and sold when it crossover the FMV according to SMH, for a total return of around 267%.   What about if we bought NVDA and just held it from 2018 till now?   Our investment would be up to $1636.52 for a total of around 718%.   This is why stationarity matters   , because it will affect how our investment does! You see it worked well on SPY and QQQ because there was stationarity to ensure consistency, but NVDA does not have it, too erratic.   So what about if you have stationarity?   If you have stationarity, then good! The principle is, you want to long the stock when your X value is positive (indicating it is undervalued by comparison to your co-integrated pair) and get out and/or short the opposite stock when your x value is negative.   As an investment strategy, I generally recommend not shorting, but just getting out when the x value turns negative (i.e. is over-valued), or simply setting a stop-loss to maintain the bulk of your gains and letting it do what it do.   You can also apply this on the shorter timeframes, like the 1 hour or 2 hour or 4 hour, like the examples I showed above.   Concluding remarks   So that concludes my very lengthy post. I really hope you learned something from this, took something away. These are really complex topics and there are not a lot of good resources out there on how to do them properly. Even just finding resources on the Dickey Fuller test, which is predominately only used in economics, was difficult. So I wanted to provide some information on these more complex strategies and principles that I think most traders and investors should have some idea about.   Hope you enjoyed and safe trades to all!   Thanks for reading!",

This harmonic is a shark pattern, but they have a tendency after the C wave to turn down and sometimes very harshly (just the nature of the harmonic). They can be bearish or bullish, but only after the entire bearish embedded harmonic sentiment has ran their course.  Note this same type of pattern in Bitcoin (slightly different but the same).    How far down?? Leave your comment below.   The FED is printing money at an unstoppable rate and has been doing so. Inflation is rising not just nationally but Globally. Sure we do get the hints of better days, but they are short lived.  I think this is primarily because there wasn't as harsh of an economic impact during COVID. Now that the pandemic is subsiding some (still not gone), the money printer is being over worked to a point where it may not be able to do much at all. Large companies are laying off (reminiscent of pre COVID days).  There are other indicators as well in the DOW and NYSE to further support something BIG is bound to happen THIS YEAR and within the next 30-90 days which could further last well into the next few years. How bad will it get??? I am only providing the acronyms as they relate to the different levels. Keep in mind we are still in an overall bearish cycle and these small pumps we get are the hints of the money injections attempting to revive things. Banks are teetering and a few have failed. NOTE: There are banks out there in worst condition than the ones that were bailed out. What happens to them?  It has already been noted that there is not enough FDIC insurance to cover everyone so when PANIC sets in it just doesn't look good.

I am also looking at crypto markets taking a dive as well, but maybe not as bad as the traditional markets which more people are exposed to.

        "text": "Insider Trading and Corporate Activity Analysis:   Insider trading activities can provide crucial insights into a company's prospects and internal sentiment. Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN) has recently made notable moves in this context:   * Align Capital Agreement & Stock/Bonds Purchase Approval: In January 2023, ALGN secured a new agreement with Align Capital, R.S. Puram, and received approval from 60% of Directors for Stock and Bonds Purchase/Share Rights. These actions indicate the company's optimism about its stock's future performance.   * $250 Million Technology Repurchase Agreement: The announcement of a $250 Million Technology Repurchase Agreement further demonstrates ALGN's confidence in its stock's value.   News Flow Analysis:   Recent news articles shed light on ALGN's current state and market sentiment -   * $250 Million Accelerated Stock Repurchase Deal: ALGN's intent to return value to shareholders reflects confidence in its stock value.   * Accelerated Buybacks After Stock Drop: This move seems to be a reaction to counterbalance a significant price decline, potentially signaling undervaluation.   * Expected Completion of ASR Transaction: The transaction, funded with Align's cash, is expected to conclude by approximately January 30, 2024.   * New Accelerated Stock Repurchase Agreement: ALGN entered an agreement to repurchase $250 million of its common stock, emphasizing its aggressive buyback strategy.   * Stock Performance After Earnings: Despite softer-than-expected earnings, market analysts retain a positive outlook on the stock.   * Piper Sandler Price Target Adjustment: While there's a downward adjustment in price target, it still suggests a potential upside from the current price.   Financial Analysis:   * Earnings Expectation (Q3 2023): ALGN anticipates a YoY increase in earnings with higher revenues for Q3 2023.   * Earnings Report Date: October 25, 2023.   * Forecasted Earnings: $2.27 per share (YoY change of +66.9%).   * Expected Revenue: $1 billion (up 12.4% YoY).   * Earnings ESP: -3.84% (suggesting bearish sentiment among analysts).   * Zacks Rank: #2 (Buy).   * Historical Performance: ALGN has exceeded consensus EPS estimates 3 out of the last 4 quarters.   Takeaway:   Despite recent bearish sentiment from analysts, ALGN's history of surpassing EPS estimates and its strong Zacks Rank suggests the potential for a positive earnings surprise.   Contrarian Perspective:   While ALGN's upcoming earnings report holds promise, the broader tech sector faces challenges due to chip shortages. Any adverse impact on ALGN's operations or earnings falling short of expectations could exert downward pressure on the stock. Investors should pay close attention to the earnings call for insights into business conditions and future guidance.   Long Position on Align Technology (ALGN):   * Entry Point: Current market price +/- $185.20 or below, or ideally as low as $183   * Stop Loss: Tight @ $180.31 or less, or as low as $180   * Profit Targets: $196.44 (partial/swing) / $212.31 (close)   * Time Horizon: Before end of winter, 2024 (late February)   * Probability: +/- 70% up to \"Partial Profit\" target (due to positive sentiment around stock repurchase, according to ChatGPT)   Watch the Livestream ...",

How to trade this pattern:   If you believe that the double bottom pattern is valid, you could buy JBLU above the neckline of the pattern (which is currently around 3.60). You would then place a stop-loss below the 3.40 level.   If JBLU breaks through the neckline of the pattern, it would be a bullish signal and could indicate the start of a new uptrend.

TSLA   is one stock that has done really well with Time@Mode signals, basically in every timeframe, for as long as I've been following it (since   @timwest   introduced me to it in 2015)   The quarterly uptrend expired end of June this year, which suggests that price action will be choppy for approximately 15 quarters in a row. Until then, it's probably ok to hold, if you don't have anything better to do with the funds invested in the stock and are ok with the opportunity cost. Personally, I hold no exposure to it and don't plan on it until we have long term clarity again.   I did a mode to mode projection for the next long term target in the stock, the last time I did this I got an approximated target of something between $118 and $336. You can see my old long term forecast in related ideas below.   Currently, I can estimate that price can eventually reach the vicinity of $3280 to $4100.   I'm confident in it getting there over time, but it can take a long wait, maybe by Q4 2026 to get the next trend signal, which will precede the start of steady acceleration to the upside.   Best of luck if you're a shareholder, and if you're not stay tuned for the next long term bullish signal in the stock, I'll be sure to catch it and share it with my clients.

However, it looks like the odds of breaking down has diminished with a bullish monthly pin bar now forming after finding support at its 88.6% fib retracement (imperfect double bottom).   The stock is still below its 200 day MA but this MA is  less relevant for a stock that is just ranging sideways for the past few years. It can still be a good candidate for swing trade due to its wide range.   The daily chart is starting to exhibit reversal patterns with higher highs (HH) and higher lows (HL). The recent earnings gap up on huge volume was a good catalyst.  And the subsequent pullback to almost close the gap (and today's \"bullish harami\" to signify potential rebound) provided an opportunity to long at lower risk.   Ready to test a small long position with initial stop loss just under $83.50 (allowing for gap fill that might still stand a small chance  of happening IMO)   Disclaimer:   This is just my own analysis and opinion for discussion and is NOT a trade advice.

Ahead of earnings on Oct 31st, AMD has printed a bullish engulfing candle above the highs of the previous 3 candles and is closing into a previous resistance.   Note that AMD on the higher timeframe (weekly) is forming a sort of descending channel within what seems to be a huge pennant. This descending channel is also being at the HTF uptrend support.   Another piece of confluence is that price has broken the downtrend on the lower time frames while bounce from a demand and trendline support. Also, the stochastic and RSI are both oversold with both curling up.   Trade Idea:   As I do not trade earnings drops, I will wait for price action to confirm a trend change and move above resistance at 99.75 - 100.45 and hold above this level while forming a trend. If I get the trigger, I will expecting for price to make a move above to retest the downtrend line of the descending channel and possible even the major resistance at 111.09 - 111.77.   Targets:   105.56, 109.20, and 111.09   STOP:   Daily candle close below 93.31, Weekly candle close below the green uptrend support line.

It has 88% institutional holdings. A compression pattern is developing. HFTs have been in it recently, possibly due to intermittent accumulation. The strengthening of the sideways action is particularly visible with the RSI indicator.   Dark Pool accumulation tends to cause controlled sideways patterns like this, a key ingredient for what we call   Relational Technical Analysis   at TechniTrader.   Because this has had a swing-style run out of the last compression pattern at a low in this longer trading range, a swing trade could be considered on the breakout, either above today's high or above the last resistance level for a more conservative entry. (Green lines on the chart) My target would be 31, but of course I'd be watching for exit signals or an extreme pattern to take profits early. Stop loss at the red line on the chart.   A more aggressive trader could look at an entry ahead of the close today if pro trader patterns emerge in the last 15 minutes with an exit shortly after the open if a run or gap up develops for an EOD to FOD trade.   Happy Trading!   Guest author: Mele Ainuu, Senior Technical Analyst, Student Support @ TechniTrader",

Although there is a chance the correction in SPX could be over, we can never be sure until it manages a higher high (HH) at least.   JBL on the other hand, has demonstrated good relative strength to the market, eking out higher highs (HH) and higher lows (HL) despite the broader market correction.  This type of stock has a higher odd to out perform the market for the longer run.   It appears to be finding support at the 61.8% fib retracement of its recent AB upswing, supported by a bullish divergence between it's price and RSI.   Going long with an initial stop about $1 below its recent pivot low @ C ($119).   Trail stops up when trade is working out.

Analysts are closely monitoring PayPal's third-quarter earnings report to assess the company's current standing and future prospects. Despite projected earnings of $1.16 per share, PayPal's stock has been struggling, experiencing a 32% drop since the beginning of the year, despite positive earnings reports.   So far this year, the stock has declined by 28%, with a 13% drop in October alone. This downward trend raises doubts about PayPal's ability to recover, especially since it lacks strong historical support levels. While the stock may find some support around the $50 mark, a significant rebound is necessary for a complete recovery. In fact, to reach its all-time high, the stock would need to surge by a staggering 505%.   Another significant obstacle is surpassing last year's low of $66. The upcoming third-quarter earnings report, scheduled for release on November 1st, will be crucial in determining PayPal's near-term outlook and its ability to navigate the challenges within the industry.",

        "text": "In the last five years, shares of Costco Wholesale (COST -0.19%) have made for a wonderful investment, climbing 149%. This gain is much better than the broader market indices. But the stock is still 11% off its peak price (as of Oct. 27).   There is a lot to like about this company. Those looking to buy shares right now need to spend some time understanding more about Costco and the current situation.   With that being said, here are three facts the smartest investors know about this top retail business.   1. A membership-based business model   Anyone can go visit and shop at a Walmart, Target, or Home Depot location. This is typical in the retail industry.   However, Costco does things differently. Consumers must shell out $60 (for the basic plan) or $120 (for the Executive plan) a year to become Costco members, thus allowing them to shop at one of the company's 862 warehouses worldwide. This strategy has been successful, as there are currently 71 million member households, a figure that was up 7.9% year over year. Plus, these memberships registered a renewal rate of 92.7% in the U.S. and Canada in the most recent quarter.   From the company's perspective, this membership model is a financial boon. It drives customer stickiness, which can reduce marketing expenses and support strong revenue gains. It allows Costco to keep the pricing markups on its merchandise under control, as the business isn't trying to maximize product gross margin. And lastly, membership revenue provides a major boost to the bottom line.   Costco also has proven pricing power with its memberships. Costco is due to raise membership fees since it hasn't done so in over six years, but customers likely won't resist if history is any indication. The savings provided by being a Costco member far outweigh the annual fee.   2. An uncertain macro environment   Costco's revenue soared to double digits in both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022. The pandemic and its aftereffects spurred demand from consumers to shop at Costco. Perhaps elevated levels of inflation also drove people to these stores, as saving as much money as possible was the priority.   But like many businesses these days, the uncertain macro backdrop is providing a bit of a headwind. Net sales were only up 6.7% in fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 3), with same-store sales rising 3%. And for fiscal 2024, Wall Street consensus analyst estimates call for revenue to increase 4.9%.   The company's management team points to weaker demand trends as they relate to big-ticket, discretionary items. These include things like electronics and jewelry, for example.   3. An expensive stock   Thanks to Costco's outperformance historically, the stock isn't cheap. It currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 38.4. Costco's shares are trading at a value that's more expensive than its past 10-year average of 33.1.   The valuation also represents a huge premium to rivals like Walmart (P/E of 31) and BJ's Wholesale Club (P/E of 18.6). This is likely warranted, as a valid argument can be made that Costco is a superior business to these two competitors.",

        "text": "Its been reported that BlackRock has engaged in preliminary discussions with Jane Street, Virtu Financial, Jump Trading, and Hudson River Trading, with regards to their potential involvement as market makers for a spot Bitcoin ETF.   Amid the crypto crackdown, a BTC ETF, if approved, would open a new pathway for U.S.-based firms to get a piece of the crypto action  in a way that plays to their conventional strengths.   Some of the world's largest market-making firms are in the mix to potentially provide liquidity for BlackRock's eagerly awaited bitcoin ETF if regulators approve the product, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.   Trading giants Jane Street, Virtu Financial, Jump Trading and Hudson River Trading have held talks with BlackRock about a market-making role, according to a BlackRock slide deck reviewed by the person familiar with the matter.   Assuming the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approves some or all of the dozen or so applications for bitcoin ETFs (including the one from BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager), that would open a new pathway for U.S.-based firms to get a piece of the action in crypto  in a way that plays to their conventional strengths. Being a market-maker for ETFs, which trade on exchanges just like stocks, requires a level of sophistication and automation that only a relatively few companies can achieve.   Market makers are vital to ETFs. They are responsible for creating and redeeming new shares of an ETF, a role designed to keep its price tethered to the price implied by the value of the ETF's holdings.   One of the best examples of why such a create-and-redeem structure is important actually comes from crypto. Grayscale Investments offers a product called the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) whose price has over the past few years wandered dramatically far away from the billions of dollars worth of bitcoin (BTC) that it owns.

        "text": "Understanding Cathie Wood's Trading Methodology   1. Introduction   In the dynamic world of finance, few have garnered as much attention in recent years as Cathie Wood, the visionary founder and CEO of ARK Investment Management. Underpinning her meteoric rise is a trading methodology that champions disruptive innovation and a futuristic outlook. Let's dive deep into what makes Wood's strategies stand out.   2. Historical Context   Investment, for decades, thrived on the mantra of 'safety first.' Blue-chip stocks, steady dividends, and bonds defined portfolios. However, the digital revolution brought with it companies that didnt fit the traditional mold. Here, Wood saw an opportunity, challenging traditional norms and adopting an approach anchored in tomorrow rather than yesterday.   3. Disruptive Innovation as the Core   At the heart of ARK's investment strategy lies disruptive innovation. These are technologies or business models that transform industries and often render old methods obsolete. Think about how streaming altered entertainment or how electric vehicles (EVs) are reshaping mobility. In these disruptions, Wood sees not just change but investment opportunities.   4. Research-Driven Approach   While many firms tout the depth of their research, ARK goes a step further. It actively bridges the gap between sectors, combining insights from tech, healthcare, energy, and finance. The firm even collaborates with academia, startups, and online communities, believing that understanding disruption requires diverse perspectives.   5. Active Management and Portfolio Construction   Passive investing, tracking indices, has its merits, but Wood's vision is anything but passive. ARK's active management is about agility. As new research insights emerge or market dynamics shift, ARK's portfolios evolve, ensuring they reflect the most promising opportunities in disruptive sectors.   6. Contrarian Views and High Conviction Bets   Wood has never shied away from making bold claims, be it her bullish price target for Tesla or her belief in Bitcoin's potential. These high conviction bets might seem risky, but for Wood and ARK, they're informed decisions, grounded in research and a genuine belief in a company's or technology's transformative potential.   7. Exit Strategies and Risk Management   Every investment strategy, no matter how bullish, requires an exit plan. ARK's exit strategies, while not always publicized, are undoubtedly rooted in their rigorous research. Changes in a company's fundamentals, regulatory landscapes, or unexpected industry shifts can all trigger an exit. Additionally, risk is actively managed, with diversification strategies and hedging to cushion potential downturns.   8. Transparency and Engagement with the Public   A distinctive hallmark of ARK is its commitment to transparency. Unlike many peers, ARK frequently publishes its research, trades, and theses. This openness invites both praise and scrutiny, fostering a two-way dialogue between ARK and the investor community.   9. Criticisms and Challenges   No strategy is beyond critique. Wood's high conviction bets, while often profitable, expose portfolios to potential volatility. Detractors also argue that her strategies are too growth-focused, potentially overlooking stable, value-driven opportunities.

        "text": "Netflix jumped earlier this month after announcing results. Its now consolidating, and some traders may see potential for more upside.   The first pattern on todays chart is the bullish gap on October 19 following the quarterly report. Prices cleared a peak of $394.90 from two weeks prior and have remained there since. Has old resistance become new support?   Second, that level is near the 50-day simple moving average (SMA).   Third, NFLX is now trying to form a bullish inside week. That could indicate the stock is digesting its gains and consolidating.   Next you have the falling trendlines along the peaks of July and September. Traders could be watching for a breakout through this resistance.   Short-term indicators may also have gotten more bullish: The 8-day exponential moving average (EMA) is above the 21-day EMA, and MACD is rising.   Last, the fundamental case may have improved because NFLX entered earnings season under a cloud of negativity. It then shocked the bears with strong subscriber growth, making it a potential turnaround story.

How does any of this help an actual trader? Especially one trading daily and even more so one trading options and or futures.   Youve got accounts who have HUGE followings, and they bother emailing me and posting on X that the SPX will trade $4200-$4600 lol?   UH OK!   Like why do we get these updates daily?   Or they say watch for the SPY to trade back to $430 range before figuring out if it can go higher. LOL!   This is all just absurd. I surely don't think I'm the greatest chartist or trader and yet I find their information to be typically worthless daily and my own analysis to be FAR more worth checking daily should i have time to give it. But even if you go back and look at what i said days ago, you'd have IMO a far better and more actionable layout of the land.   As for the Spy how about we 1st figure out if we are getting back above this R at $417 and $20 ranges. BEFORE we begin watching for $430.   Especially with so many earnings reports on deck and even bigger than that J Powell about to speak tomorrow.

        "text": "Shares of Western Digital Corp. (WDC) surged more than 6 % in early trading Tusday before giving back some gains after the computer hard drive manufacturer said it would spin off its flash memory business.   The decision comes amid lower demand for flash memory chips that has led to a supply glut in recent quarters. Last week, Western Digital abandoned lengthy discussions of a merger with Kioxia, a Japanese memory drive maker, which is owned by a consortium led by Bain Capital and is the former semiconductor unit of Toshiba.   Western Digital's decision to spin off its flash memory unit is a win for activist investor Elliott Investment Management, which last year advised the company to make such a move.   Western Digital first ventured into the flash drive business in 2016, when it acquired SanDisk, a California-based manufacturer of flash memory cards, for $19 billion. The spinoff of the flash memory unit will effectively unwind that transaction.   Western Digital shares were nearly 8% higher around 3:30 p.m. ET, after surging more than 10% early in the session. They've risen by almost a third so far this year.   Analysts at Wedbush Securities assigned an \"outperform\" rating for WDC, and are eyeing a price target of $60 per share.   Price Momentum   WDC is trading in the middle of its 52-week range and above its 200-day simple moving average.   What does this mean?   Investors are still evaluating the share price, but the stock still appears to have some upward momentum. This is a positive sign for the stock's future value.",

Still, the price is failing to break above the top (Lower Highs trend-line) of the blue Channel Down and technically the longer it fails to do so, the higher the chances become of a rejection. Until that happens, we can see that during similar 1D MA50 consolidations after price jumps in the recent past, Netflix rallied more. Now it has the 1W MA100 (red trend-line) as its long-term Support, hence a potential new rally can be even stronger.   The previous 3 medium-term rallies have hit (or marginally missed) the 2.0 Fibonacci extension, so that is our target in case the price breaks above the top of the Channel Down. $600 is technically fair as it is on the Higher Highs trend-line of the Bullish Megaphone. Time-wise, this target is achievable by January 2024 as this is what the Sine Waves suggest. As you can see all 3 previous Higher Highs have been within the peak spectrum of the Sine Wave.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------   ** Please LIKE , FOLLOW , SHARE  and COMMENT  if you enjoy this idea!

Bulls need a close above $312 to attempt a change in course and possible move to the top of the range else the double top looks likely to unfold.   A double top is a bearish technical reversal pattern that forms after an asset reaches a high price two consecutive times with a moderate decline between the two highs. It is confirmed once the assets price falls below a support level equal to the low between the two prior highs.   This pattern, resembling an M shape, signals a medium or long-term trend change in an asset class. Its important to note that its not always easy to spot because there needs to be a confirmation with a break below support.   While a double top is a bearish signal, its counterpart, a double bottom, is a bullish signal. A double bottom resembles a W shape and indicates a potential bullish price movement following a downtrend.   In trading, these patterns are often used as signals to sell or enter short positions (in case of double top) or buy or enter long positions (in case of double bottom) in anticipation of market changes.",

My guess would be the same way we expect any harmonic pattern to work. I could not exactly feel comfortable drawing any Bat or Butterfly harmonic patterns some may know it but I drew some... structural hotspots of when to expect this to move dramatically. Now based on some previous data I have seen on Bitcoin, I know that you can have seemingly a perfect reversal pattern from a pattern literally curving like a smile and still continue in the previously indicated direction. So I have simply expressed the points are major stress, it being the structural squeeze and some measurements based on the previous volume wells that led us to this moment. Either we hit $105 or we go to $35. I would extend the possibilities more but there are some structural interruptions that may be mirrored so the resistances or supports may be perceived fully from the squeeze this is probably going to have.

Just look at this bullish divergence from the low of January 2016, monthly RSI is now close to the 50% middle line as well. This stock has lost 90% of it's value from ATH, like most of the 3D printing stocks since 2014.   I can do a multiple time frame analysis if people are interested in this setup. The weekly and daily also look bullish, and if you look at the linear scale, the price is also at a very interesting macro level in relation to the uptrend and forming a inversed head and shoulders. The master of all reversal patterns, all that while volatility seems to be contracting heavily on small timeframes... This setup looks too good to be true, honestly. But the whole 3D printing sector has been correcting for a decade now due to heavy speculation when it came out (bubble) and problems with mass production.

Should this be backtested as support, I believe Paypal stock will try to breakout of this falling wedge.

        "text": "Chart was brought up on my stream today, and I wanted to post a chart. Looks like a nice run-up stock looking for a decent crash that should equal some pretty large percentage losses. Short term parabolic stock, so when those green trends break, the pump is pretty much over, and you'll want to start looking for an exit or short position on the retouch, which looks like it might end up being 13.9, but it's too hard to say right now, as those trends are held up on weak support.   CCC Intelligent Solutions Holding Inc. exhibits promising signs in its current chart analysis. On the daily timeframe, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is indicating a bullish sentiment, although we haven't detected strong trend momentum yet. However, what makes this chart intriguing is the presence of a potential 'cup and handle' pattern nested within a larger 'cup and handle' formation.   Digging deeper into the 4-hour chart, we find crucial trend support, which has not been breached, and the RSI has yet to cross into bearish territory. This solidifies the foundation for a robust short-to-medium-term outlook.   Furthermore, a notable price gap has been observed at $12.5, providing an interesting point of reference for potential price movement.   The 1-hour RSI suggests a short-term correction may be on the horizon, supported by a subtle emerging trend. This could strengthen our 4-hour trendline, potentially setting the stage for a surge towards the $14 mark, with an optimistic stretch target of $15.72 in the event of favorable developments.   It's essential to note, however, that the 5-minute and 15-minute charts are currently showing signs of being overextended, indicating a need for caution in the short term.   In terms of price targets, we have an upper range of $13.9 to $14.05, while the lower range stands at $8.47 to $7.41. While a maximum price of $18 to $20 is not entirely out of the realm of possibility, it's essential to maintain a realistic perspective, and such levels may not be easily attainable.   In the unlikely event of a significant downturn, the stock could potentially dip below $5. In such a scenario, it's crucial to be prepared for a potential bounce when the drop stabilizes.   Looking ahead to the start of the trading week, should Monday open with a downward movement, it could present a compelling buying opportunity around the $12.54 mark, aligning with the prevailing trend. Such a move would also serve to reset the technical indicators, potentially paving the way for a push towards $14 and beyond.   In conclusion, CCC Intelligent Solutions Holding Inc. holds promise in its chart patterns and technical indicators, making it an interesting stock to watch. As with any investment, prudent risk management is advised, but the potential for exciting price movements in the coming sessions is certainly worth keeping an eye on.   Personally, I don't know if I'll give this stock another look, but I'll try to keep the prices update on my site, should it really start to get away from this chart. But overall, be careful, sell fast, and possibly try to enter a short position, it's a pretty nice setup, with limited but very real risk.   Analysis does not take any fundamentals into account. I've never heard of this company before.   Nick   Yolo to the Moon",

This level is significant in technical analysis and may influence the future price movement of $OXY.   1. **Fibonacci Retracement:** Fibonacci retracement levels are key areas on a price chart derived from the Fibonacci sequence. The 0.618 level, often referred to as the \"Golden Ratio,\" is a crucial retracement level. It's used by traders and analysts to identify potential support or resistance zones where price reversals or significant price reactions can occur.   2. **$60.39 Price Level:** In the case of   OXY   , the $60.39 price level corresponds to the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. This means that if the stock's price reaches this level, it could potentially find support, as this level is considered significant by traders and investors.   3. **Seeking Support:** When a stock approaches a Fibonacci retracement level, traders watch closely for signs of support. This means that buying interest may increase as the price approaches or reaches $60.39, potentially leading to a bounce or reversal.   4. **Potential Reversal:** Finding support at the 0.618 Fibonacci level could suggest that   OXY   is poised for a potential upward reversal. Traders often use this as an entry point for long positions, anticipating a bullish move from this level.   5. **Confirmation and Caution:** While Fibonacci retracement levels can be valuable tools, it's essential to exercise caution and look for additional confirmation, such as candlestick patterns or other technical indicators, before making trading decisions based solely on this level.   6. **Risk Management:** Traders should always implement proper risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders, to protect their positions in case the stock's price doesn't behave as expected after reaching the 0.618 Fibonacci support level.   In conclusion, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (   OXY   ) is currently approaching a crucial technical level at $60.39, which corresponds to the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. Traders and investors are closely monitoring this level for potential support, which could lead to a price reversal. However, it's essential to consider additional technical factors and employ effective risk management when trading or investing in   OXY   or any other asset.",

Our goal is to find a low support point and enter. It can be referred to as buying at the pullback point. The pullback point can be found with a Fibonacci extension of 61.80%. This is a step to find entry level. 1) Find a triangle (Fibonacci Speed Fan Line) that connects the high (resistance) and low (support) points of the stock in progress, where it is continuously expressed as a Slingshot, 2) and create a Fibonacci extension level for the first rising wave from the start point of slingshot pattern.   When the current price goes over 61.80% level , that can be a good entry point, especially if the SMA 100 and 200 curves are gathered together at 61.80%, it is a very good entry point.   As a great help, tradingview provide these Fibonacci speed fan lines and extension levels with ease. So if you use the Fibonacci fan line, the extension level, and the SMA 100/200 curve well, you can find an entry point for the stock market. At least you have to enter at this low point to avoid trading failure, and if you are skilled at entering this low point, with fibonacci6180 technique, your reading skill to chart will be greatly improved.   If you want to do day trading, please set the time frame to 5 minutes or 15 minutes, and you will see many of the low point of rising stocks.   If want to prefer long term range trading, you can set the time frame to 1 hr or 1 day.",

However also do not forget while everyone with larger accounts on X may be telling you we now bounce back to much higher levels before they even begin to watch for rejection. Some of those same accounts that said support was at $412 to $415 when I said you'd be seeing $400-$410 before a bounce.   Well larger accounts now eyeing. $425-$430.   I'm still saying watch for rejection issues at the $417 and $420.   IMO that $417 level has more confluence and possibilities for overhead R then most are giving it credit for.   Even if we break back through it later, I'll be watching for at least one decent rejection and shorting from it was my plan.   Even if my Puts bought at closing don't pay tomorrow, we did great with the Friday puts from R given that morning at premarket as well as playing it basically the same way this morning. 0Dte puts and 31st puts were up 55-110% within the 1st 2 hours of trading. Most were closed WAY into profits within the 1st hour or LESS of trading.   Now we see what the MM do over night and if they can keep pushing it UP.   On the #spx   SPX   I'll be watching for R at the 4180-4190 level.   My puts will begin there for at least a daily pullback to make $ in that hour. I think puts from $4187 look sweet for a daily play.   If I'm wrong you'll clearly have your receipts, lol",

Our goal is to find a low support point and enter. It can be referred to as buying at the pullback point. The pullback point can be found with a Fibonacci extension of 61.80%. This is a step to find entry level. 1) Find a triangle (Fibonacci Speed Fan Line) that connects the high (resistance) and low (support) points of the stock in progress, where it is continuously expressed as a Slingshot, 2) and create a Fibonacci extension level for the first rising wave from the start point of slingshot pattern.   When the current price goes over 61.80% level , that can be a good entry point, especially if the SMA 100 and 200 curves are gathered together at 61.80%, it is a very good entry point.   As a great help, tradingview provide these Fibonacci speed fan lines and extension levels with ease. So if you use the Fibonacci fan line, the extension level, and the SMA 100/200 curve well, you can find an entry point for the stock market. At least you have to enter at this low point to avoid trading failure, and if you are skilled at entering this low point, with fibonacci6180 technique, your reading skill to chart will be greatly improved.   If you want to do day trading, please set the time frame to 5 minutes or 15 minutes, and you will see many of the low point of rising stocks.   If want to prefer long term range trading, you can set the time frame to 1 hr or 1 day.",

And like I said, theres no way around that. If we just try to do some copycat vehicle design, of which there are literally 200 models that are slight variations on a theme in the combustion engine world, distinctions without a difference, then its really not that hard. But if you want to do something radical and innovative and something really special, like the Cybertruck, it is extremely difficult because theres nothing to copy. You have to invent not just the car, but the way to make the car. So, the more uncharted the territory, the less predictable the outcome.   Now, I can say that-- if you say, well, where will things end up? I think well end up with roughly a 0.25 million Cybertrucks a year. I dont think were going to reach that output rate next year. I think well probably reach it sometime in 2025. Thats my best guess.   A recession would also be a major blow to Tesla, as consumers would likely tighten their spending and delay or cancel purchases of new cars. In addition, Tesla is still ramping up production at its new factories in Texas and Germany, and a recession could make it more difficult to meet its production targets   Higher interest rates would make it more expensive for consumers to finance Tesla vehicles. Tesla has relied on strong leasing demand to drive sales growth, but this could be hit hard if interest rates rise significantly.   Tighter financial conditions could make it more difficult for Tesla to raise capital. Tesla has ambitious plans to expand its production capacity and product lineup, but it will need to raise a significant amount of money to do so. If financial conditions tighten, it could be more difficult and expensive for Tesla to borrow money.   A recession would lead to lower demand for Tesla vehicles. Tesla vehicles are still relatively expensive, so consumers are more likely to delay or cancel purchases of a Tesla if they are facing financial difficulties.   A recession could disrupt Tesla's supply chain. Tesla relies on a global network of suppliers for its components. A recession could lead to disruptions in this supply chain, which could make it difficult for Tesla to produce vehicles.   Overall, a combination of QT and recession would be a major challenge for Tesla. The company would need to find ways to reduce costs, increase demand, and secure financing in order to weather the storm.",

This pattern is considered to be a bullish reversal signal, as it indicates that buyers are gaining control of the market and that the downtrend is likely to come to an end.   To identify a bearish to bullish parallel downtrend break, traders look for the following characteristics:   A downtrend channel is formed by connecting the lower highs and lower lows of a security's price action.   The security breaks out of the downtrend channel to the upside.   The breakout is accompanied by an increase in volume, which indicates that there is strong buying pressure behind the move.   Once a bearish to bullish parallel downtrend break has occurred, traders may enter long positions in anticipation of further upside momentum. Traders should also place stop-loss orders below the breakout point to limit their losses in case the security falls back into the downtrend channel.

        "text": "As those that have been following along for the last few weeks you know that I mentioned wave iv should be long, deep, and complex. The reason for this is due to wave ii being short, shallow, and simple. It was so simple, I thought it was incomplete and misses my favorite trading opportunity...wave 3 of (3) of C. All is well that ends well though, at least I didn't lose any money. Fast forward to wave iv and we are back in the spot where the count tries to confuse people. This stuff is always easy to count in hindsight, but in the moment, not so much.   I posted the main chart on the 4HR because I want everyone to have a bird's eye view.   BIG PICTURE IS KING.   You can see how little wave ii is already compared to what I am still calling wave iv. If you assume iv has already ended that would mean it was actually shorter than ii. According to the alternation theory that shouldn't happen. If iv ends tomorrow or Tuesday as I mentioned on Friday, that would put it at three times as long as ii. IMHO, I feel MACD needs to work its way up closer to baseline too before we start to drop for wave v. All of these things combined plus more are why I think we still head up to the low $220's before dropping again. Below is how i am counting this thing on a micro level using the 3min chart.   As always, I have an ALT count too. This shows it is technically possible we have already started wave v. Again though, the only thing that points down in an impulsive fashion is a leading diagonal for v. This would suggest wave iv is shorter than ii and wave v started in a pretty rare pattern. Most of the time when people think they see a diagonal, they're wrong lol. It isn't until they're down the line they realize they were wrong. Personal bias helps that go a long way and can be dangerous if not kept in check.   My plan for this week, (which if one is to be successful, they MUST have a plan) is to sell these calls I have and buy puts close to the top of wave iv. Then ride v down and sell the puts/buy calls towards the bottom & ride (4) up for the next retrace. I doubt v finishes this week, but just in case it does I have already planned ahead. The call positions I enter on the counter trend will be very small in size. Most likely I will sell them quickly too. I don't trust trading counter trend trading very often but I imagine wave iv should be a $25 bump or so.   Don't forget to give this post a like and a follow if you find it useful. It is every one of you that helps the word spread. God bless and good luck!   Bonam Fortunam,   --Tyler",

I decided to leave these boxes as I have been able to refine price a couple times to a more accurate area over time. This last move up looks corrective to me and given how small micro-wave 2 was that doesn't really surprise me micro-wave 4 would be larger. We made what some would call a \"triple top\" right at the 0.382 fib retracement of micro-wave 3 which is a common end point for wave 4's.   If I am correct and this last move up is still apart of wave v of (C) of II, then OML is on the menu. This is where the smallest box comes in. It is my most recent target and where I believe price will conclude this descent down. With-in this box is the 0.786 fib retracement of the entire wave I, 1.382 of primary (A)-(B) of wave II, and major fib confluence right in the center of the box. I didn't place it there due to the fib confluence either. The fib conf. is just another indicator that price is very likely to bottom there.   There is the possibility that we have bottomed already and should move much higher soon but that has changed to my ALT count. For those that will no doubt be wondering, I am holding on to these calls as they don't expire until January of next year. If price does make a bottom in my target area, then I will buy another 20 contracts minimum as I feel it is a great buy and a potentially very lucrative position.   Bonam Fortunam,   --Tyler",

        "text": "Per   ]my analysis here   , I'd like to point out an update that we have just set a higher low from the multiple compression low of VIX and VIX/VVIX from the mega bull run early this summer.   This is a sort-of warning shot that the market is starting to become unsettled about sustaining these prices long term. Does that mean sell it all right now? No, certainly not. This is only the first higher low on the weekly chart.   But, if we see another successive higher low in VIX/VVIX as the price action in   SPY   and   QQQ   bounce back in the coming weeks to possibly re-challenge the summer's highs if not even go past them some, it's time to start thinking about taking profits and taking a net short position, if you ask me.   That might be a month away, maybe a couple months away, it's hard to say. Just keep an eye out.   For options plays starting from yesterday (Friday 8/19/23) I'd start positioning with some positive delta exposure for the coming weeks, but keep an eye out to flatten and reverse that trade in the not distant future. Maybe we get a nice reversal to the upside to end August, but September has historically been the worst month for bulls on average.   I have a feeling that no matter what the Fed says at Jackson Hole this week, the re-positioning that happens around it after having been down in the couple weeks leading upto it, we may have a pop to the upside as big players re-hedge, and IV may well drop again as the market de-risks after digesting what they have to say.   But, as we round out August, if it appears the new IV and VIX/VVIX low post Jackson Hole is a higher low than the previous dip, I'd start flipping to have a negative delta exposure for sure, possibly for a longer term trade towards the end of the year. This could be somewhat like 2H 2018 all over again, but can't say if there is an aggressive bounce off a big low towards the end of the year. Will have to keep an eye on economic data. We're in a much more tenuous position than we were at the end of 2018.",

        "text": "Energy company Exxon Mobil Corp. reported profit in Q3 2023 amounting to 9.1 billion USD. It decreased compared to last year's results but still managed to exceed analysts' expectations.   The recovery in energy prices played a significant role in achieving this profit level. The ongoing tensions in the Middle East have, to some extent, positively impacted the issuer's financial results. If the situation in the energy market changes, Exxon Mobil's profits might begin to fall.   Therefore, today, we focus on the Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) stock chart.   On the D1 timeframe, support has formed at 105.11, with resistance at 116.44. There were attempts to break through support, and a \"false\" breakout at 105.11 is likely to develop. There are attempts to rebound in the premarket, but they are very weak.   On the H1 timeframe, if there is a rebound from the 105.11 level, there is a chance that the new upward movement will start with the short-term target at 114.55. In the medium term, the target for the price increase can be around 120.52.

        "text": "This is not something I would use as a trading signal by itself, but it is a good indicator on the weekly chart of how bigger players are viewing risk appetite.   High yield corporate bonds, as seen reflected in ETFs like   HYG   and   JNK   , are an interest data point. High yield implies that these are riskier bonds with a higher chance of default on the debts. Just like as individuals, we have credit scores and when we apply for loans, the interest rate can vary depending on how the bank rates us risk-wise on perceived ability to pay back the debt, those who have a lower score might get a higher interest loan because they are considered higher risk of default. Same basic principle applies to corporate debt.   When liquidity is flowing and the economy overall looks good, large investors/investment banks will feel better about buying riskier high-yield bonds and other debts because we're in an economy paradigm where there's a better chance that not enough of those will default to cause significant harm to the debt holders.   But, when the economy is getting pinched for whatever reason and liquidity starts to dry up, high risk, high yield debts are much less desired due to perceived increased risk of default.   Sometimes the high yield debt moves pretty close in tandem with the market, see for example the dumping that happened during the 2020 COVID panic.   Before and after that, you can often see a bearish divergence in   HYG   and   JNK   many weeks before the S&P finally tops out and begins its decline. The above chart, you can see the decline become more obvious as we wind down 2017 and head into 2018, then also see it again pretty obviously in the second half of 2021 before the sell off for most of 2022 started.   Both   HYG   and   JNK   came online around 2007-8 timeframe, just before the GFC. You can see a pretty steady decline right from the beginning there, and a rapid rebound as things find bottom.   What is interesting is how far both   HYG   and   JNK   came down throughout 2022, and while equities have since had a nice recovery bounce for most of 2023, the high yield bonds have not had such a recovery. It's actually instead slowly condensing price action with slightly higher lows, but also lower highs. We seem to be nearing the end of that wedge and hopefully soon we get an answer on what the risk appetite really is of risky debt, because it will be a solid signal of where equities may be headed next.   Personally, I'm already seeing some indications that as we approach the end of the year, we may see a larger dip in equities. For how long and how large, that remains to be seen. For right now, we're having a recovery rally from selling off most of August and I'm not seeing any indication it's a good time to go against that trend, but that may change in the coming weeks.",

We are seeing a push back towards this zone with the formation of a bearish wedge that is more likely to break to the down side than the upside.   Additionally, Tesla vehicles are becoming increasingly more affordable as they continue to slash prices on newer vehicles which may have a negative impact on the overall bottom line for Tesla.

Since then, GME has done nothing but make a series of Lower Highs into Support area @ 37.95-45.55.   These Lower highs into support area displayed the weak buyer pressure by bulls. A bearish Descending Triangle was formed.   After 10 months of failing to break a high, in Nov.21 Bulls did the unexpected and broke out of the Triangle looking to continue the previous up-move.   This Breakout was short lived as the pressure from the sellers overwhelmed the buyers. Price was shot back down below Triangle breakout point. The breakout move was deemed a False breakout/Price rejection.   In Dec.21, the false breakout was followed by price breaking down below Support area @ 37.95-45.55 and the 50 ema. This is the 1st time since Aug.20 that price falls below and lost Support of 50ema.   All of 2021 was spent by the Bulls/Buyers trying to fight off the Bear/seller pressure and trying to stay above Support area @ 37.95-45.55 and the 50 ema.   They were systematically broken down and eventually overwhelmed and conquer by the Bears/Sellers.   2022   After breaking down from Support area @ 37.95-45.55 and the 50 ema, by end of Jan.22 price made a Lower Low and found new Support @ 22.20.

Support area @ 37.95-45.55 and the 50 ema were turned into Resistance area/level.   Price bounced one move time from Support @ 22.20 to Support turned Resistance area @ 37.95-45.55. We have a Price rejection pattern here. This is cue to enter trade short.   The Bulls/Buyers have spent all of 2022 moving sideways between new Lower Low/Support level @ 22.20 and previous Support turned Resistance area @ 37.95-45.55 and the 50ema.   After a hot 2 weeks in Jan.21 that saw price fly from 9.75 to 120.65, GME has now spent 81weeks moving side-ways with the Bears/sellers systematically breaking down the Bulls/Buyers.   Now with the 2nd price rejection @ Resistance area @ 37.95-45.55 and the 50ema, Bears will look to move price back down to Support @ 22.20 and then breakdown to Support area @ 9.75.   Why hasnt #Wallstreetbets put their powers together again and save the bleeding out GME bag holding fanboys still talking about going to the moon?   Sad to see them let the fanboys over @ AMC get cooked earlier this week.   With extreme bear conditions and price siting at area of value, I will be entering trade short.   Short term trade   Entry: 33.53   Stop loss: 22.20(-22.98%)   Target: 22.20, +33.93%, +1.48 RR ratio   Long term trade   Entry: 33.53   Stop loss: 52.50(-56.76%)   Target: 10.00, +70.14%, +1.24 RR ratio",

SBUX tried to get above $95 but failed to close there in two separate weeks. Such price action could reflect selling pressure.   Next, the coffee chain stalled at a low from July 7. Has old support become new resistance?   Theres also potential confluence with the 50-day simple moving average (SMA).   Speaking of the 50-day SMA, it had a death cross under the 200-day SMA in July. That could indicate a bearish trend over the longer term.   This chart includes our   2 MA Ratio   custom script in the middle study. It shows that the 8-day exponential moving average (EMA) crossed below the 21-day EMA on Friday.  That could suggest the short-term trend is turning bearish as well.   The most recent sessions also featured a potential bearish flag breakdown.   Finally, stochastics are dipping from an overbought condition.   Traders could focus on these signals with earnings due on Thursday, November 2.

Global systemwide sales  which include sales at company-owned and franchised restaurants  increased 11%. Global same-store sales jumped 8.8%, higher than analysts' estimates of 7.79%, per Bloomberg consensus data.   Revenue jumped 14% year-over-year to $6.69 billion, higher than estimates of $6.52 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 3.19, up 19% from last year.   Shares of McDonald's are down nearly 3% year-to-date, trailing behind Restaurant Brands International (QSR) which is up nearly 2% year-to-date, but ahead of YUM! Brands (YUM) shares, which are down nearly 7%.   As consumers buckled down on where they spent their money, McDonald's says it got a boost in the US.   In the US, sales benefitted from higher menu prices, new marketing campaigns, and growing digital and delivery orders. Beginning in August, the company launched its As Featured In Meal campaign that showed meals that have appeared in films, movies or TV shoes.   Baird analyst David Tarantino said McDonald's typically gains foot traffic when there are \"mounting macroeconomic uncertainties\" in a note to clients, adding that the Golden Arches is \"one of the best positioned brands...to navigate a tougher backdrop.\"   During the financial crisis from 2008 to 2009, sales growth averaged 3.4% in the U.S. and 6.9% in Europe, he said.   The company also reported systemwide digital sales  which includes sales made on the app, delivery or on the kiosk  totaled $9 billion across its six biggest markets, making up 40% of total sales. That's more than Q2, which saw $8 billion in digital sales.   Price Momentum   MCD is trading near the bottom of its 52-week range and below its 200-day simple moving average.   Investors have been pushing the share price lower, and the stock still appears to have downward momentum.

EPS came in at $2.31, compared to $3.80 in the year-ago quarter.   The reported revenue compares to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 billion, representing a surprise of -1.01%. The company delivered an EPS surprise of +49.03%, with the consensus EPS estimate being $1.55.   While investors closely watch year-over-year changes in headline numbers -- revenue and earnings -- and how they compare to Wall Street expectations to determine their next course of action, some key metrics always provide a better insight into a company's underlying performance.   Since these metrics play a crucial role in driving the top- and bottom-line numbers, comparing them with the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated about them helps investors better project a stock's price performance.   Here is how ArcBest performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:   Asset-Light - Operating Ratio (Non-GAAP): 100.9% versus 99.8% estimated by two analysts on average.   Asset-Based - Operating Ratio (Non-GAAP): 88.8% compared to the 92.7% average estimate based on two analysts.   Revenues- Asset-Based: $741.19 million compared to the $727.41 million average estimate based on three analysts. The reported number represents a change of -6.4% year over year.   Revenues- Asset-Light: $419.31 million versus $405.60 million estimated by three analysts on average. Compared to the year-ago quarter, this number represents a -30.6% change.   Revenues- Other and eliminations: -$32.15 million versus -$28.50 million estimated by two analysts on average. Compared to the year-ago quarter, this number represents a -27.3% change.   Operating income Non-GAAP- Asset-Based: $82.81 million compared to the $56.29 million average estimate based on two analysts.   Operating income Non-GAAP- Other and eliminations: -$4.20 million compared to the -$6 million average estimate based on two analysts.

A candle closing above it, would invalidate the medium-term bearish bias and most likely restore the stock back on long-term bullish trend. The 1D RSI Double Bottom is what at the moment is shifting the sentiment a little more towards a potential bullish break-out. On the other hand, a break below the 4H MA200 will cancel it.

        "text": "I am a big supporter of PayPal but I believe its share value will get worse before it gets better. According to its Q2 2023 results, the online payment company experienced a deterioration in its liquidity with a cash ratio difference (cash/total current liabilities) of -0.04 when compared to its Q2 2022 results. The Q3 2023 Earnings Call taking place on Wednesday (1 November 2023) should set the tone for what to expect in the coming months, a steeper drop in share price or a much desired recovery.   PayPal has had a rocky year with the retirement of its veteran CEO, Dan Schulman, who was officially succeeded by Alex Chriss last month. Because Schulman's departure was planned and not sudden, the change in leadership is not a concern for me. The online payment giant also recently launched its own stablecoin showing its willingness and capability to evolve with the times. All-in-all, I believe PayPal's shares have been mostly rocked by factors outside of its direct control (rising treasury yields, pandemic lockdowns lifting, recession fears, etc) so I am anticipating the Q4 2023 to be a pivotal moment as I believe that's where we will see how Chriss has managed the company.   Despite the expected turbulence I am going to load up on LEAPS calls as I believe this company is extremely undervalued and is due for a strong recovery once the current macroeconomic disturbances subside. If the price continues to slip, I can see us hitting a support around $40 which will be the lowest the stock has been since February 2017. While this would be difficult to stomach, it offers an exceptional purchasing opportunity. A potential near-future recovery to the $58.50 level is also possible; $65 would be the next stop if the $58.50 ceiling is surpassed.   Speculative foresight: noting Elon Musk's prior history with PayPal and his long-term desires for operating an online bank (a desire he has expressed exercising with the newly acquired Twitter, now X, platform), I believe we can expect an attempted merger or acquisition from Musk once he has extinguished the current fires at Tesla and X. In my opinion, an attempt to takeover PayPal would attract high volatility which could launch PayPal's shares to prior highs. This is all speculation of course and probably will not occur for several years, if at all.   PYPL",

Analysis of the Structure:   I see that we are in wave IV of (a) of y of 2 at the moment, developing as a double zigzag. The peak is expected on Monday morning, then we start a week of bearishness as wave V of (a).   My potential target for wave IV peak is 169.48 and my target for wave y bottom is around 160.96 (since wave IV is not finished yet, I have calculated 160.96 based on my wave IV target of 169.48).   Analysis of the Cycles:   On Thursday (October 26th) we got the first 10D cycle trough of the second 20D cycle of the second 40D cycle of the first 80D cycle of the current 20W cycle.   I am expecting the 80D cycle on November 2nd. This means I expect a bullish bounce caused by the earnings report.   So, this week is going to be aggressively bearish until we get the 80D cycle trough, also the bullish bounce out of it is going to be considerable (4-5 weeks of bullishness).",

The original swing created a range in which price kept moving around (mostly above the 50%) - which indicates to me in general upwards strength.   With the range high taken out, price constantly moved between the upper resistance level and the 50% before breaking down.   As the range low was now taken out i see a retest of the 50% and or even break above it.   A small obstacle to overcome is the lower resistance level - which i think will hold price for a short period of time down.

However, we are in a pre-election year and have been receiving somewhat good news in regard to economy cooling.   That being said, we will be receiving new information on Sept 13 on the CPI and YOY inflation readings for August.   The DXY is currently pushing in a resistance zone after a large move up, and may potentially be in a region for a short. This may help push markets upwards towards the upper liquidity zone around $460 on the SPY.   I would not be surprised if the market pushes slightly higher before creating a SFP swing high failure with rotation back downwards.   My reasoning is based on identifying the divergence which may give us a warning sign that a reversal may be near. Ive indicated previous divergences which resulted in pullbacks to both the upper and lower ranges of the chart.   My Major levels to the downside would be the critical level between $410-$420.

        "text": "Trade Plan for Spotify (   SPOT   )   Reasons for the Trade:   Positive earnings report.   Strong consumer sentiment.   Formation of a Bullish PEG candle.   Notable sell-off in alignment with the broader market.   The stock's performance offers potential for both long and short opportunities.   Price retracement to the critical level of 159.50 (or rounded 160). A substantial deviation from this point is a bearish indicator.   Long Setup:   Entry: Look for a bullish movement away from the 159.50 mark, supported by 15-min bullish volume and candlestick patterns.   Key Level to Watch: A break above 165.30, which corresponds to the AVWAP from the earnings announcement.   Stop Loss: Set at 157.66.   Profit Targets:   First target at 165.29 (scale out 50%).   Second target at 167.75.   Risk Management: After hitting 165.29, move the stop loss above entry for a breakeven scenario.   Risk Allocation: 0.50% of the portfolio.   Short Setup:   Entry: Anticipate a bearish price action that breaks below the 159.49 mark.   Entry Confirmation: Rely on price action combined with volume metrics.   Stop Loss: Set at the 162 pivot.   Profit Targets:   First target at 155 (scale out 50%).   Second target at 150.   Risk Management: After achieving the 155 target, adjust the stop loss to breakeven. Ensure there's significant volume during the break of 155 to anticipate a continued downtrend.   Risk Allocation: 1% of the portfolio, given the prevalent bearish sentiment in the broader market.",

Bearish signs: Technical cues predict more drops.   Key Levels to Watch:   Immediate: $10.00 (critical psychological barrier)   Below: $9.56, $9.11, $8.41   Special Note: $10.20 zone (major make-or-break area)   How to Trade: Step-by-Step   Set Up for Success:   Add an Anchored VWAP on the chart, starting from the earnings moment.   When to Jump In:   Price dips below $10? Go short (sell, expecting to buy back cheaper).   But: If it's heading toward the VWAP, pause. Wait for a clear sign.   Protecting Your Capital:   Set a stop loss at the VWAP level shown on a 1-minute chart (e.g., was $10.24 last Friday).   Cashing In: The Smart Way:   First target: $9.56. Hits it? Great! Sell half to lock in profits.   Move your stop loss to where you entered the trade (break even). You're now playing risk-free!   Holding On for More?   Still got half your position? Watch those lower levels ($9.11, $8.41) for more profit-taking.   What If Things Change?   Price climbs above the VWAP or starts hovering around $10.20? Be alert! Big decisions happen here.   If it starts breaking through the bearish patterns, that's the market telling you something new.   Golden Rules: Keep These in Mind   Trading's not about certainties; it's about playing the odds smartly.   Stick to the plan, but be ready to adapt. Conditions change fast.   Most importantly, don't risk more than you can afford to lose. There's always another trade.",

Going long on LSCC and short on ON could capitalize on their differences, aiming for a reversion to their historical performance relationship.   Why Go Long on Lattice Semiconductor (LSCC):   Valuation:   LSCC has a higher P/E of 47.88 compared to ON's 19.15, often an indication that the market expects higher growth prospects from LSCC. Additionally, LSCC's forward P/E of 28.53 signals that the market is expecting the earnings to improve in the near future.   Profitability:   LSCC has an ROA of 27.38% and an ROE of 40.53%, which are both higher than ONs figures of 16.60% and 31.59%, respectively. This indicates better utilization of assets and equity for LSCC. The expected EPS growth for the next year for LSCC is 17.96%, which is more than double ON's expected 8.33%.   Performance Metrics:   Despite recent short-term declines, LSCC has had a strong Perf Year of 38.90%, making it a candidate for a potential rebound.   Why Short ON Semiconductor (ON):   Valuation:   While ONs current P/E of 19.15 is lower, its forward P/E of 14.76 may not show as much expected growth in earnings as LSCC, given that ON's current P/E is already lower than LSCC's forward P/E.   Short Interest:   ON has a short float ratio of 5.49%, indicating some level of negative sentiment, which could support a short position.   Profitability:   Although ON has healthy profitability metrics, they are generally lower than LSCC's. An ROA of 16.60% and ROE of 31.59% don't measure up to LSCCs robust figures.   Performance Metrics:   ON has seen negative trends in the Perf Week, Perf Month, and Perf Quarter metrics, which may reinforce the short position.   Decision:   Long on 1 LSCC   Short on 1 ON",

        "text": "META   Price Target1: 276$   Price Target2: 265$   15th Dec PUT Options   Trend Analysis: The stock has been in an upward trend (bull market) for a considerable time, as indicated by the rising price action and the rising Relative Strength Index (RSI) line. However, this upward trend seems to have reversed recently, indicating the start of a bear market.   Bearish Divergence: The chart points out a bearish divergence, which is a technical signal indicating potential trend reversal. A bearish divergence occurs when the stock price hits higher highs, but the RSI does not confirm these highs (i.e., the RSI makes lower highs). This suggests that the upward momentum might be weakening.   Volume Profile: The volume profile on the right side shows the price levels at which the most trading occurred. The wider the horizontal bars, the more trading volume occurred at those price levels. These levels can act as support or resistance in the future.   Price Decline: There are two significant price declines highlighted in the chart, with percentage drops annotated. The stock faced a steep decline, losing a significant portion of its value during those periods.   RSI Levels: RSI values above 70 typically indicate that a stock might be overbought (potentially overvalued), while values below 30 suggest it might be oversold (potentially undervalued). The chart showcases moments when the RSI crossed these thresholds.   Predictions:   The highlighted bearish divergence and subsequent price drop might be a warning to traders and investors about potential future declines.   The question mark implies uncertainty or a need for decision-making regarding the stock's future direction.   The bear market label suggests a prediction or declaration that the stock has entered a downward trend.",

A byword for the age: Those who can, build; those who can't, invest.   The funding deal, according to sources familiar cited by The Wall Street Journal, reportedly involves $500 million now and up to $1.5 billion later, though subject to what, if any, timing or conditions is unclear. I've asked Anthropic for comment on the matter.   It recalls  though it does not quite match  Microsoft's enormous investment in OpenAI early this year. But with Amazon committing to as much as $4 billion to Anthropic, the funding gap is probably more theoretical than practical.   The Google investment is just the latest in a developing proxy war between rival companies with a limited number of champions to back. Though all these companies are powerful and expert in many areas of technology, the simple fact is none of them would be able to stand up a credible competitor to either OpenAI or Anthropic in the area of large language models. And since everyone is also betting that LLMs are going to upend their business models and become crucial components of any future tech platform, they can't afford to not have at least partial ownership of the leaders in the space.   They have more than money, as well: It would be similarly difficult for the AI startups (though one may well question that title now) to stand up the infrastructure needed to build and deploy these AI models at the scales required to operate profitably. So the deals also involve things like compute credits and mutual aid.   Price Momentum   GOOGL is trading in the middle of its 52-week range and above its 200-day simple moving average.

A death cross is when the 200 moving average (red) crosses below the 50 ma (green)   The first 2 times the death cross occurred (yellow circles)  GME witnessed a 43% drop and 90% drop respectively.   In the week of August 7, 2023, GME had its third death cross.   Will the death cross play out and GME see more downside or is this a bull flag?   With time, price movement will reveal itself.   Currently GME has been in a downtrend since 2021.  And for one full year the 50 ma has been acting as resistance and pushing price down.   On another observation, if this downward channel, after a parabolic rise of 8,200% is a bull flag, then we need to carefully monitor which way price beaks out of this channel.   Will it break below the channel and invalidate the bull flag, or will it break above the channel and possibly head higher?",

If price breaks below the $6.35 level, it would then test $5.00 as support.

The price has played out vector 10-11 and is currently forming a bearish vector 11-12 within the sideways range.   The daily chart also shows a sideways pattern. The bearish vector 9-10 has been technically played out. However, a significant selling zone has formed almost throughout the sideways range, triggered by the candle on 25.10.23, which incidentally had the highest trading volume in the last 3 months. The zone was tested by the candle on 27.10.23, The seller resumed from the zone, as indicated by the candle's wick.   The most likely scenario is for the price to break out of the daily sideways range to the downside (lower boundary at 324.39), protect this breakout, and play out the bearish vector of the weekly sideways pattern.   Targets for short positions:   309.5 - the lower boundary of the weekly sideways pattern.   295 - the extremum pierced by the candle on April 24, 2023.   275 - the buyer's zone at the lower boundary of the monthly sideways pattern.   If a buyer emerges at the lower boundary of the weekly sideways range, targets 2 and 3 may become irrelevant.   Good luck with your trading!

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger acknowledges there were some headwinds Intel was facing when he took the job, and his goal was to \"rebuild this iconic company.\" With the latest results, he says \"people can see the momentum is building\" at Intel thanks to cost-saving initiatives, product execution, and its internal foundry model.   Intel plans to launch new products including the Core Ultra processor, which Gelsinger nicknamed the \"AI PC\". Gelsinger says the AI PC aims to keep users from having to go to the cloud to utilize AI, instead, the features and data are readily available on the device itself to improve productivity. Gelsinger says these products will help Intel capitalize on the \"surge in AI interest we're seeing across the board.\"   With new products slated to launch over the next two years in its data center unit, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger believes the chipmaker can regain lost market share and boost competitiveness, stating 2024 is when Intel will \"start gaining back share\" thanks to its upcoming product releases.",

I think a lot of people are holding cash and expecting to see $390 and will \"buy the dip\".

That is the divergences forming in various areas. Now, it is not a guarantee that market is done selling and it will be straight up next week. But it is interesting that if things were so bad out there, we shouldn't be seeing some of the things that we are seeing at the moment.   1. Inverse Vix: putting in a lower high from last week to this week as market selloff intensifies. VIX should be pumping right now, not getting weaker. Inverse vix should be plummeting, not gaining strength.   2. Volume: As prices falling and candles getting bigger, we are not really seeing volume to support it. As price is now at a very strong support area, we need to see extreme volumes to break through the level. If volume keeps getting smaller, that will mean sellers are exhausted. This doesn't mean selling is done. It means, a substantial bounce would be in the making in the coming days.   3. RSI: RSI is remaining on the same level as last week. Seller strength is weakening. This also doesn't mean a reversal, but it means that the floor might not open up just yet.   4. Unrelated, but important; bitcoin and crypto are breaking out. Usually, crypto market initiates the risk on trend.   Now, this $410 area in SPY is very important. Price can fall a little bit more, but this support has been months in the making and market will not just give it up. Next week I am expecting a bounce.

Had a 20D cycle trough on October 17th.   Currently, in the first 5D cycle of the first 10D cycle of the second 20D cycle of the second 40D cycle of the current 80D cycle.   Already overshot all the FLD targets, they can not guide us to find the bottom price.   Monday (23rd of October) is a 5D cycle trough and Friday (October 27th) we will have a 10D trough.   November 3rd or November 6th we will have the 80D cycle trough.   20W cycle is expected in the last week of December or the first week of January (wave (a) of z).   6-7 months of bearishness ahead of us.   20W FLD generated a target of 174 for that trough (wave (a) of z).   Update:   Every point mentioned in the summary above actually happened this week.   Analysis of the Structure:   Wave IV of (c) of Y developed (not complete yet) as a triangle. I see wave IV completion Monday early morning, then we will have a week of bearishness to bottom around 180 as wave y of 2. This will lead to a few weeks of bullish price action.   Wave IV is not complete yet and that is the reason I am not giving a precise target for wave y bottom, but it will be around 180.   Analysis of the Cycles:   Right now, we are in the last 10D cycle of the current 80D cycle. As mentioned before, I am expecting the 80D cycle trough on November 3rd.   This means next week is gonna be aggressively bearish, also the bounce out of this trough is gonna be strongly bullish.   An interesting fact is that the 80W cycle FLD is sitting right at 182 next week on November 3rd!",

Etc. etc. etc.   So I am just writing it out, because had I shared it when I originally intended, it probably would have been more helpful, since we bounced off of a key level recently.   Above is the 3 month high/low range, superimposed with the 6 month low range/thresholds.   You can see that we have removed target #1 for the 6 month low (420), which is very close to target #1 on the 3 month low (415).   The interesting part about this, which I have shared in my other idea, is that the 6 month bear threshold aligns with the 3 month bull threshold at around 431. This means that, 431 should be a really key area of resistance. Failing to break over that should lead us to those lower red boxes in the 404 to 399 range.   One little interesting tidbit though is there is a high prob target at 429:   Just right below the bull threshold on the 3 month and bear threshold on the 6 month. I am fine with this, because it doesn't require a break of the bull/bear condition to be hit. But what it tells us is there is a high chance we see a move back up to that 429 / 430 range.   And what it also tells us is that we may not see my 419 this week during market hours. We managed to wick down there premarket but we quickly reclaimed the bear threshold on the 3 month, which has been acting as pretty strong support.   Based on the setup, the move should theoretically be a move to 429 / 430 from here, since we technically lost and reclaimed the threshold in pre-market.   If we break out of the bull threshold/back over the bear threshold on the 6 month, the immediate target would be for a move back to the bull threshold on the 6 month at 451 (I would be pretty ticked if this happened though, honestly).   For the 3/6 month, I classify a break and hold as 3, full day closes above the threshold.   Either way, this will serve as our EOY roadmap. Which will forever be marked by the almighty pumpkins.   So if you come back to reference this in December, you will be reminded that Halloween is the best :P.   Those are my thoughts, safe trades everyone!",

        "text": "Sure, here's the analysis of Meta (formerly known as Facebook) based on the information you provided:   Stock Performance: Meta has recently experienced a stock price increase of over 160%. This is a significant rise and may indicate that investors were enthusiastic, and the stock's performance exceeded typical expectations. This is an important factor that can impact the future stock price.   Overbought Zone: Your mention of a mildly overbought condition on the weekly chart is important. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a useful indicator for identifying overbought or oversold conditions in the market. If RSI reaches values above 70, it can signify that the stock is overbought and may be due for a correction.   Bearish RSI Divergence: The formation of a bearish RSI divergence on the daily chart is a crucial signal. A bearish divergence suggests that the strength of the uptrend is weakening and could be the beginning of a reversal. This is an important signal for technical analysts, indicating a potential price decline in the future.   Profit-Taking: Meta has seen substantial growth since its last decline. When investors witness such significant growth, they may be inclined to start taking profits. This can lead to increased selling of shares and a decline in the stock price.   Based on this information, it might be expected that the price of Meta's stock could decline in the near future. However, it's important to note that financial markets are unpredictable and can be influenced by many other factors, including news, geopolitical events, and market trends.   It's important to consider that investing based on technical analysis is just one of many approaches to investing. Before making any investment decisions, it's advisable to consult with a financial advisor and consider all available information about the company and the market.",

Trend & Moving Averages:   The stock has been on a downward trajectory recently, as evidenced by consistent lower highs and lower lows.   It has been trading below the orange and blue moving averages, reinforcing the bearish trend.   However, there is a sign of potential consolidation or reversal, as the stock price oscillates around the moving averages in the recent few candles.   Support & Resistance Levels:   Bullish Line at 41.91 USD: This seems to be a recent support level. The stock has bounced from this area a couple of times, suggesting its importance.   Target Price 1 at 42.29 USD: This is a minor resistance level. If the stock can break and hold above this, it might aim for higher levels.   Target Price 2 at 42.94 USD: A significant resistance level. If the stock can break through this, it might confirm a bullish reversal.   Target Price 3 at 43.43 USD: This is the next potential target if the stock can sustain its momentum after breaking through the previous resistance levels.   Volume:   There's a noticeable spike in volume on the last candle. The increasing volume might suggest heightened interest or activity in the stock, but it's crucial to determine the nature (buying/selling) of this volume in conjunction with price movement.   Ichimoku Cloud:   The stock is trading below the shaded cloud area, typically seen as a bearish sign. For a bullish confirmation, one would like to see the stock price break and maintain above the cloud.   Potential Reversal Indicators:   The stock's recent behavior around the moving averages and its approach to the resistance levels might suggest a potential change in momentum or a period of consolidation. This needs to be watched closely, especially in conjunction with volume and other technical indicators.   To conclude, while Halliburton Company has shown a bearish trend recently, there are signs of potential consolidation or a shift in momentum. It's essential to keep a close watch on how the stock behaves around the mentioned support and resistance levels.",

Currently it's at 47 cents and in what I refer to as,  \"no man's land.\"   It's \"no man's land\" because there's no support below it to keep price from falling further.   Could price reverse?  Sure it could.   If price does reverse, it would retest 95 cent first because currently that is the last support level. (Shown in the middle chart)  I'm not saying price would shoot up to 95 cents immediately.  It would stair step its way up to around 95 cents, and from there we would need to look at the charts further.   MIDDLE SCREEN:   FGEN has been making lower highs and lower lows since July 2018.   It has been in a downtrend for 5 years.  And to reverse a downtrend this large takes a lot of energy.   The last 8 months FGEN has fallen 97%.   If you look at this chart, you can visually see the last 4 candles potentially printed the pole of a bear flag, which is a parabolic move down.   If this is the pole of a bear flag, you would see an eventual rise in price, possibly retesting 95 cents or $2.72 (yellow lines.)  And then a break back down continuing the bearish trend.   I'm not saying this bear flag will play out, I'm just throwing out a scenario.  But if FGEN started to see a rise in price, 95 cents would be the next resistance level.   RIGHT SCREEN:   I use the 2 month chart like a cheat code.  I know this is a very large time frame, but it's fairly accurate and there's less stress if you don't mind holding for a year or so.   The oscillators give clues on a general time to buy and sell.  Yellow circles are the buy area and the white circles are the sell area.   The most recent buy and sell area yielded a 145% gain in 364 days.   The orange circles are there to remind me that both oscillators are below their white horizontal lines, and I'm waiting for the cross in the stochastic rsi.   This strategy is just a generalization.  But it can give insights on what might be happening to price in the future, especially when momentum and strength in the oscillators are over sold in the large time frame.",

Shares of AppFolio (APPF 6.32%) jumped Friday after the real-estate software company reported a substantial surge in revenue growth and a meaningful improvement in profitability in the third quarter. The stock touched a new all-time high early in the session, and as of 12:45 p.m. ET, it was up by 7.7%.   AppFolio shrugs off the market slump   AppFolio, which offers cloud-based software for managing rental properties, reported its results for the third quarter after the close Thursday. Revenue was up 32% year over year to $165.4 million, its highest quarterly growth rate since 2019. This was ahead of expectations, bolstered by the sequential addition of roughly 100,000 net new rental units managed by its software.   Moreover, AppFolio's operating income improved from a $7.8 million loss last year to a loss of only $100,000 this year -- essentially breakeven.   A couple of analysts raised their price targets for AppFolio stock in light of the Q3 results. For example, DA Davidson analyst Peter Heckmann has a buy recommendation on AppFolio, and according to StreetInsider, he just raised his price target on it from $230 per share to $240 per share.   AppFolio expects a strong finish in 2023   In light of that strong quarterly performance, AppFolio's management raised its full-year revenue guidance. Before, it had been predicting revenue in the range of $592 million to $598 million. Now, it expects revenue of between $608 million and $612 million.   The midpoint of that new guidance range assumes fourth-quarter revenue of $161.4 million, which would be about a 30% year-over-year jump. That's solid growth in a challenging market, and it could keep AppFolio stock flirting with its highs.",

Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.   Do you wonder why?

Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

        "text": "Boeing results topped analyst expectations Wednesday thanks to a pickup in commercial aircraft deliveries as the manufacturer increases production, but losses in its defense and space businesses drove the manufacturer into the red for the quarter.   The company generated $2.6 billion of free cash flow in the second quarter, ahead of analyst forecasts, and reiterated its full-year guidance of between $3 billion and $5 billion of free cash flow.   Boeing shares surged 12.70% just in a week, and closed on Friday at $238.69, the stocks highest closing price since November 2021.   Heres how the company performed during the period ended June 30, compared with Refinitiv consensus estimates:    Adjusted loss per share: 82 cents vs. 88 cents.    Revenue: $19.75 billion vs. $18.45 billion    Boeing and main rival Airbus have both struggled to increase aircraft production in the wake of the Covid pandemic as some airlines face longer waits for new jets, just as travel demand rebounds.   The company delivered 136 planes in the second quarter, up from 121 aircraft during the same period last year.   Meanwhile just a take a look what historically happened with Boeing stocks, almost every time after 10+ percent weekly advance. In simple words - that's been a flat, or even more than 10 percent decline.   Technical picture indicates that Bearish trend still is in power in   BA   stocks, and 5yrs SMA is still a huge resistance.",

Late Friday  we flush within 40 points of trendline support  and Close right on top of daily 200ema.

Here you can see the rising wedge formed  that i think will take us back to 428,-430.   There's so much resistance  in that  area that you have to pause on any higher targets until spy closes over 432 again.   1. Fib resistance   2.

        "text": "Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does use debt in its business. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?   Why Does Debt Bring Risk?   Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.   The good news is that Apple's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its EBIT growth rate. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start.   Price Momentum   AAPL is trading in the middle of its 52-week range and below its 200-day simple moving average.   What does this mean?   Investors are still evaluating the share price, but the stock still appears to have some downward momentum. This is a negative sign for the stock's future value.",

However, there is some ideas going around that the FED has planned and purposely changed this to support their \"higher for longer\" narrative. Powell did state that they are not fully committed to these rates if things in the economy change, so it was likely a statement made to give the market some kind of guidance and attempting to removing uncertainty.

HAL - is one of the best stocks in the energy sector, with impressive consecutive earnings and sales growth 4 qrts in a row and double digits growth in eps estimates.   Beside strong fundamentals, I always look for the price to establish reliable basing pattern with low risk entry point. Preferably I want this pattern to fit well into the larger elliott wave context, having upside potential within the price structure.   Within the structure from 2020 lows, I can see at least one more move to the upside into 40-45-47 area of larger resistance.   Trading plan:   if price manages to break out above Friday's highs with volume rising above average, I will be planning to start building the position with 3-5% stop. Further follow-through above 36.2 and later 36.9 area would be a signal to add-on to position.   Other technical signs to consider:   - I was wowed by five (!) consecutive tight weekly closes. History of true market leaders (TML) through out each and every up-cycle teaches us that every TML had 2-3 weeks of tight closes during initial phases of price advance.   - Though afterward breaking out from 5 weeks tight base, price faced 5 weeks of decline below this base, with some signs of distribution. Probable that was due to general market sell-off, but price is still below key 10w. MA, meaning it is still vulnerable to the downside;   - I like the break-away gap in the beginning of October - sign of strength.   The short-term potential of the analysis is valid until price stays above Oct. lows.   Caution: Earnings are scheduled next week.   Important notice: Elliot waves and fibonacci retracements are a very subjective form of analysis and I don't personally trade out of them. I use them only for the purpose of gauging structural potential of any assets, that allows me to put more confidence when low-risk trading set-up emerges.

        "text": "The e-commerce giant's Q4 revenue guidance also beat Wall Street's expectation.   Shares of Amazon (AMZN 7.49%) jumped 5.4% in Thursday's volatile after-hours trading session, following the e-commerce and cloud computing leader's release of its third-quarter 2023 report.   The gain is attributable to the quarter's revenue and earnings both sprinting by Wall Street's estimates, with the bottom-line beat a particularly big one. Investors were also likely pleased that revenue guidance for the fourth quarter -- the particularly important holiday quarter -- exceeded the analyst expectation.   1. Revenue grew 13%   Amazon's net quarterly sales grew 13% year over year to $143.1 billion, easily surpassing the $133.4 billion Wall Street had expected. That result also edged by the company's guidance range of $138 billion to $143 billion. Excluding the favorable effect from foreign-currency exchange, revenue increased 11% from the year-ago period.   Year-over-year revenue growth at AWS continued to slow on a sequential-quarter basis. In the prior three quarters, the cloud computing unit's year-over-year revenue grew 12% (Q2 2023), 16% (Q1 2023), and 20% (Q4 2022). This slowdown is industrywide, as many businesses are being cautious with their spending due to the uncertain macro environment. On the earnings call, management expressed optimism that the surging adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) will be a big tailwind for its AWS business.   That said, AWS's profitability increased significantly (as discussed in the next section) more than its revenue, and profitability growth, arguably, is more important than revenue growth.   Moreover, Amazon's e-commerce business's revenue growth outperformed Wall Street's  expectations, which more than compensated for AWS's revenue falling just a tad short of the Street's estimate ($23.06 billion vs $23.13 billion). This dynamic underscores the benefit of diversification.   2. Operating income soared 348%   The quarter's operating income more than quadrupled from the year-ago period to $11.2 billion. This result walloped Amazon's guidance range for operating income between $5.5 billion and $8.5 billion.   AWS's operating income growth was robust on both a year-over-year and a sequential basis. As noted in the chart, it jumped 30% year over year, and it also increased 30% from the prior quarter (Q2 2023).   In the prior quarter, AWS's operating income edged down 5% year over year to $5.4 billion.   3. Earnings per share surged 236%   In Q3, net income was $9.9 billion, or $0.94 per share, up 236% year over year. This result crushed the earnings per share (EPS) of $0.28 that Wall Street had expected.   The quarter's net income includes a pre-tax valuation gain of $1.2 billion included in nonoperating expense from Amazon's common stock investment in electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive, which went public in November 2021. The year-ago quarter's net income had included a pre-tax valuation gain of $1.1 billion from the Rivian stock.   4. Operating cash flow rose 81% for the trailing year   Operating cash flow jumped 81% to $71.7 billion for the trailing-12-month period. Free cash flow (FCF) was $21.4 billion for this period, compared with negative $19.7 billion in the year-ago period.   The company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $50.1 billion, and long-term debt of $61.1 billion.   Investors should mainly focus on Amazon's operating cash flow, rather than its FCF. FCF can jump around a lot quarter to quarter based on how much money the company is investing in growth initiatives.   5. Revenue is expected to grow 7% to 12% in the fourth quarter   For Q4, management guided for net sales in the range of $160 billion to $167 billion, which would amount to growth of 7% to 12% year over year. This guidance includes an expected favorable impact of 40 basis points (0.4 percentage points) from foreign exchange rates.   Going into the Q3 report, Wall Street had been modeling for Q4 revenue of $157.2 billion, so Amazon's top-line guidance was higher than what analysts had been expecting.   Amazon, which doesn't provide earnings guidance, also said that it expects Q4 operating income will be between $7.0 billion and $11.0 billion, compared with $2.7 billion in the prior-year period.   A good overall quarter   Amazon turned in a strong quarter, especially considering the uncertain macro environment.   With its leading positions in two massive growth markets -- e-commerce and cloud computing -- Amazon still has a long runway for growth.",

        "text": "DexCom, Inc. DXCM reported third-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 50 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents by 47.1%. The company reported earnings of 28 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.   DXCM registered GAAP net income per share of 29 cents, up from the year-ago quarters figure of 24 cents.   Shares of DexCom rose 17% in after-hours trading on Oct 26, following better-than-expected quarterly results. However, the stock has lost 28.4% year to date compared with the industrys 15.5% decline. The broader S&P 500 Index has moved up 10% in the same period.   Revenue Details   Total revenues grew 27% (26% on an organic basis) to $975 million on a year-over-year basis and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4%. Strong revenue growth was driven by rising volumes on the back of increasing global awareness of the benefits of real-time Continuous Glucose Monitoring and strong customer additions.   Segmental Details   Sensor and other revenues(90% of total revenues) increased 31% on a year-over-year basis to $873.8 million. Hardware revenues (10%) decreased 2% year over year to $101.2 million.   Geographical Details   U.S. revenues (73% of total revenues) increased 24% on a year-over-year basis to $713.6 million. International revenues (27%) improved 33% (30% on an organic basis) year over year to $261.4 million.   Margin Analysis   Gross profit totaled $623.3 million, up 26.1% from the prior-year quarters level. DexCom reported a gross margin (as a percentage of revenues) of 62.7%, which contracted approximately 30 basis points year over year.   Research and development expenses amounted to $131.4 million, up 19.1% year over year. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $284.7 million, up 21.4% year over year.   The company reported total operating expenses of $417.8 million, up 20.5% from the prior-year periods recorded number. Operating margin (as a percentage of revenues) was 21.1%, up 190 bps year over year.   Financial Position   DXCM exited the third quarter with $3.24 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities compared with $3.64 billion in the preceding quarter.   Total assets amounted to $6.6 billion compared with $6.82 billion on a sequential basis.   2023 Guidance   DexCom raised its guidance for 2023 revenues and also raised its adjusted gross and operating margin outlook. The company now expects revenues in the range of $3.575-$3.6 billion, implying 23-24% year-over-year growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $3.55 billion. Previously, DXCM expected revenues in the range of $3.5-$3.55 billion.   DXCM now expects an adjusted gross margin of approximately 64% versus 63% previously. Adjusted operating margin is projected to be approximately 19%, up from the previous guidance of 17%.   DXCM also announced a share repurchase program worth $500 million.   Wrapping Up   DexCom exited third-quarter 2023 on a strong note, wherein both earnings and revenues beat their respective estimates. Impressive contributions from the Sensor segment, and domestic and international revenue growth were the key catalysts. Moreover, the expansion of coverage for CGM systems during the quarter supported growth. This trend is likely to continue for the rest of 2023. The availability of new sensors like G6 & G7 in new international markets is also boosting revenue growth.   Additionally, the glucose monitoring market presents significant commercial opportunities for the company. DexComs prospects in alternative markets such as non-intensive diabetes management, hospital, gestational, pre-diabetes and obesity are likely to provide it with a competitive edge in the MedTech space.   Apart from making continued advancements in terms of its key strategic objectives, the company continued to have strong new patient additions in the quarter.   The expansion of gross and operating margins buoys optimism. However, cut-throat competition in the market for blood & glucose monitoring devices remains another concern.",

In May 2022, its 'sideways' market became a 'Distribution' stage as the price broke down, entering a downtrend.   The downtrend was sharp between May 2022 and October 2022, resulting in a 42% drop in price. By November 2022, the price found a bottom and started a rally. The primary trend remains downward, but there is a change in the secondary trend.   In the first half of 2023, there was a pullback, and a secondary trend formed an upward price channel. However, attempts to break through the resistance at 36.75 in June, late July, and September 2023 failed. By October 2023, the price broke below the upward channel's support, indicating that the secondary 'upward' trend may be over, and the price could continue in the direction of the primary trend, which is downwards.   The lengthy distribution stage and ongoing resistance levels suggest significant seller pressure. The primary trend remains intact, and it appears poised to continue.

        "text": "MSFT   NVDA   GOOG   AMZN   INTC   AMD   As the common market motion is embracing a recession, one of Bloomberg's Magnificent 7 fights hard to keep a stiff upper lip. But not only as the signs of the times currently stand, but also by their own decisions, NVIDIA will get in turmoil.   Background   In my view (working in IT for 15 years), the chip designer is overreaching its capacity with the following two factors.   Planning not a new GPU, but a whole GPU architecture, for every year to release   While GPUs became an essential part of many cutting edge technologies aside graphics, an architecture means to write drivers (computer software working as interpreter between devices) for the variety of operating systems currently at the market, which are, in this order, Linux, Android and Windows.   Linux already despises the closed-source proprietary licensing model of drivers by NVIDIA, which can neither be changed nor get improved nor adapted to compatibility to Linux. An annual release of new architectures without more vertical integration of software development will result in a lack of support by the industry ecosystem, as the industry tends to adapt only to products which grow in relevance. Pick SQL, the database language.   Every other year, a new complete ISO standard of SQL is released to implement, but as buying a whole single set of standard documents comes with high costs, 2.500 USD for paper, the market adoption of new and newest issues of the SQL standards are rare, even in enterprise software. Open source database software tends to implement whatever is available for either no or low cost, so they naturally would not implement the latest standard.   The same dynamic will go on a new GPU architecture release every year, and NVIDIA, given the management is sane, will scrap that strategy after the first three or four cycles.   Planning to challenge Intel, other CPU makers   The most common processors, natural CPU chips built in every computing device, are coming from Intel or an Intel architecture, or ARM's RISCy architecture. Every successful processor ever made in the market had to either be made for a closed ecosystem of devices of their own (like the Zilog Z80 for Nintendo's Game Boy or any home computer of the 80's really, or any of Apple's devices) or it had to be compatible with Intel and its architecture and instruction set. Any other processor sold for general application in the past has failed to penetrate the market. And as Intel, as well as Intel-compatible processors from manufacturers like AMD, are widely common and available, NVIDIA faces the challenge to generate Unique Selling Points for its own CPU ambitions. What could that be?   Lower prices?   If NVIDIA thinks they could create the generations of CPUs to come in a much cheaper way, they would offer discounted hardware on the NVIDIA label, without holding to the promises everyone assumes with the brand: top-edge graphical calculation or AI. The margin would also challenge the stress-test of the ever-altering architecture leadership of Intel, giving Intel itself the opportunity to disrupt NVIDIA's development cycle by letting NVIDIA face the same challenges like Linux developers do when integrating NVIDIA's driver sets, with the additional risk that not every newly released architecture will sell.   Additional features, AI?   AI calculations are power-exhaustive, and delivering them on a CPU will add to the power consumption, and thereby energy costs, as much as overclocking already does. Heat development (and thereby fast aging) is a problem among the CPU industry of which sufficient and endurable solutions are rare. AI software runs in a cloud, preferrably, as the cloud would consist of multiple GPU cards which are cooled with means like heatpipes with chilled water or nitrogen, as well as a general A/C for the room. Describing all this already lets you picture any larger datacenter with its own powerplant, and if you can picture that, you know there is no consumer application for these kind of chips. AI-enhanced CPUs will eventually serve only a niche market, as datacenters would already have (matured and cheaper) GPUs to go for, which would by the way release annually and raise the cost, and as power grids worldwide are not ready to transport this kind of energy for a broad consumer approach.   If any of that is true, what still goes for NVIDIA?   NVIDIA will remain the most important infrastructure provider for datacenters, and by that extent, cloud providers. Neither Microsoft nor Google nor Amazon will be able to turn to other manufacturers, except they'd be successful in running   ARM-driven datacenters   , making the CPU strategy of NVIDIA even harder. Eventually datacenters will heterogenize in their inner structure to provide cost-effectively for different applications, from a homogenous set of almost equal hardware to a ring-like system for different classes of chips and applications. Many datacenters already either specialize for a certain kind of application or allow a general approach by heterogenizing their hardware, and this trend will continue and create more variety and diversification with coming hardware generations. NVIDIA, as a key infrastructure provider with a heavy foot in the AI field, will remain to be able to supply and influence the business of almost every other cloud-providing technology company, if NVIDIA only would reflect on its virtues, cap their endeavours and emphasize even more on its current strengths.",

        "text": "Two months since we gave a successful buy signal (see chart below) on Meta Platforms (META) and the stock is yet again found after an aggressive selling sequence:   The (almost) 12-month long Bullish Megaphone may be still intact but this time the price dropped below both the 1D MA50 (blue trend-line) and the 1D MA100 (green trend-line). It is however approaching not just the bottom (Higher Lows trend-line) of the Bullish Megaphone, but also Support 1 (274.50).   What makes Meta a strong buy already is that the 1D RSI entered the Buy Zone, which is the area within the bottom of its Channel Down and the Support. As long as the 1D MA200 (orange trend-line) holds, buying some here and the rest at the bottom of the Bullish Megaphone is the most optimal approach for the medium-term.   As you can see, the price action follows very distinct time Cycles (dashed curves) and right now the new one is about to begin. Our target is the $384.50 All Time High of September 01 2021.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------   ** Please LIKE , FOLLOW , SHARE  and COMMENT  if you enjoy this idea!

Is Disney going to break the trend-line and tank? ..ultimately leading to the selling off of assets, splitting up this massive monopoly on terrible/ stupid movies and stopping further destruction of Fox Studio's and Pixar's reputation?

Despite the impressive effort and resulting success of the Barbie movie, I retain a bearish view on the stock and see the potential for a Value-Trap trade.   The above-mentioned media effects combined with the presence of a large distribution schematic on the stocks Weekly chart suggest large scale operates are poised, inducing public interest in the stock, thereby engineering liquidity for a big move. Our bearish stance expects a significant markdown of the stocks price in light of decreasing sales and earnings expectation.   In the second quarter of 2023, sales fell 12% from last year.

Let's take 3 Fibs   The rise 380 to 459   The rise 368 to 459   The rise 348 to 459   The first rise had done 61.8% retracement around 411-412  levels.   The next has levels around 402-404 and the last 390 levels.   On the upside, we can see consolidation around 424 levels.   Seeing the Elliott oscillator I feel a 5 has been done from 438 to  412 levels.   Oscillator divergence in 417.81 and 411.6 can be seen.   Also 411.6 low had close at the top of the bar.   If 411.6 is broken then the downside continues to around 406+-2  levels   If we take the fall 424.81 to 411.6 419 levels could provide a level to initiate short again strict SL 422 levels.   The selling is going on from 17th October so I won't be surprised if a big move to 420 levels takes out sorts existing in the system.   At the moment I am long only above 424 and sell on the rise till 420 levels.   No comments on moving averages as all are breached.

Other than that, I don't have much to add. These are the only two counts I see as viable at this moment, and I am still leaning to us being in wave iv. I still have the three calls I bought today so hopefully we are still in iv lol. If not, then v should be ending soon, and I will sell on the wave (4) retrace. I have a feeling we will get clarity either way tomorrow as we didn't quite get it today.   Another thing to keep in mind is we made that last low on pos div. on every time frame up to the 1hr chart.

Our goal is to find a low support point and enter. It can be referred to as buying at the pullback point. The pullback point can be found with a Fibonacci extension of 61.80%. This is a step to find entry level. 1) Find a triangle (Fibonacci Speed Fan Line) that connects the high (resistance) and low (support) points of the stock in progress, where it is continuously expressed as a Slingshot, 2) and create a Fibonacci extension level for the first rising wave from the start point of slingshot pattern.   When the current price goes over 61.80% level , that can be a good entry point, especially if the SMA 100 and 200 curves are gathered together at 61.80%, it is a very good entry point.   As a great help, tradingview provide these Fibonacci speed fan lines and extension levels with ease. So if you use the Fibonacci fan line, the extension level, and the SMA 100/200 curve well, you can find an entry point for the stock market.

        "text": "EDITAS could be in the bottoming process, I am watching it for a few years now.   We have a falling broadening  wedge, on which we had a breakout already. This is part of a bigger falling wedge (blue).   It is techincally possible, we had put in the lows at 6.35 as a wave 5 (as an ending diagonal), which is part of wave V as a last wave, of the biggest Wave (II). This would indicate, for quiet a few years we have the lows.   Now, it is possible (~20%) that the wave(II) can extend, and that currently what we are forming is just a wave(IV) as a bigger ABC correction, but we should NOT ignore this good opportunity.   In the primary scenarion (bottom is in place): we already had a 5 count up (sorry for the inconsistency in the colors and the letterd counts) as a diagonal, completing the orange wave I (or wave A) up, and now, alongside with the news that shares are issued, we are having the orange wave II as an abc pullback. Due to the impulsiveness, this is certanly an a wave down, and it does not seem finished yet. It will be followed by a b wave up, and then agan a c wave down.   I have marked the turnaround/support boxes.   Possibly, with the abc we could form a head and shoulders (but target wont be reached). We would like to have the turnaround optimally in the green box. It could have a deeper pullback, so chances are, it will drop to the orange box. (I am scaling in)   Under the orange box is what I call the \"danger\" zone; it COULD still turn around, but more often than not, it is just not playing out, and being extremely risky, signaling, that possibly new lows are coming   I have already made 3 positions opened between 8-9 USD from previous months (accumulation)   Strong support (which will be my scale in zones for further accumulation):   ~8.80   ~8.40   ~7.75   I am also swing trading it(several days->weeks, shorting/buying) on a short frame based on elliott counts/luxalgo/support zones/MA's. (i.e.: if a wave seems done, put in a hedged long for 3 counts up for b wave, then short it down hedged till .618 OR 5 counts down)   On the daily:   RSI is cooling down from overbought levels, and MACD possibly diverging (already converged)   200 day MA is rejecting us,180 as well.   15day SMA, 21day EMA, 9day SMA rejected us.   50/52 day SMA is below us, but with the bottoming/pullback likely we will sip below that (but converging upwards)   On the weekly:   we getting rejected for a while on the 9.85 levels, indicating a pullback for many weeks now (again, my primary scenario it wants just a wave 2 pullback in)   RSI is pulling back, but have not diverged with the trendline, and possibly will not, i expect to provide support   MACD is coming up nicely to the base level, but deccelerating.   Invalidation for the setup is the brushed yellow line.",

Our goal is to find a low support point and enter. It can be referred to as buying at the pullback point. The pullback point can be found with a Fibonacci extension of 61.80%. This is a step to find entry level. 1) Find a triangle (Fibonacci Speed Fan Line) that connects the high (resistance) and low (support) points of the stock in progress, where it is continuously expressed as a Slingshot, 2) and create a Fibonacci extension level for the first rising wave from the start point of slingshot pattern.   When the current price goes over 61.80% level , that can be a good entry point, especially if the SMA 100 and 200 curves are gathered together at 61.80%, it is a very good entry point.   As a great help, tradingview provide these Fibonacci speed fan lines and extension levels with ease. So if you use the Fibonacci fan line, the extension level, and the SMA 100/200 curve well, you can find an entry point for the stock market. At least you have to enter at this low point to avoid trading failure, and if you are skilled at entering this low point, with fibonacci6180 technique, your reading skill to chart will be greatly improved.

        "text": "Rising yields have lead to a massive sell-off in OIL markets foreshadowing: tighter economic conditions, cheaper energy prices and lower inflation prints - ultimately resulting in a weaker dollar / stronger euro in the short term. Globally inflation took off mainly as a result of covid stimulus exacerbated by Russias invasion of Ukraine. Even though the war is far from over the supply chain kinks / export bans caused from it are mainly resolved. Lower natural gas prices result in cheaper fertilizer and food. Cheaper oil reduces manufacturing and transportation costs. Higher yields and higher energy prices are a cure for themselves.   If a Dollar pullback / Euro rally is expected, a rally in risk assets will ensue. Lower inflation leads to greater speculation of a soft landing ultimately resulting in softer economic conditions - beneficial for risk assets. I believe Oil has shown the markets hand and is notifying us of weakness in yields/dollar. Gold may look to breakout of its 3 year range between $1600-$2000.  A return to pre-war levels for the dollar will give Gold and risk assets a boost. On a longer time period, I remain bearish EURO / bullish Dollar in the long term as I believe the economy remains resilient elevating inflation into next - dispelling the soft landing scenario. However in the next 3-6 months, I can envision a weaker Dollar and all that comes with it.   Supporting Charts will be posted below.",

Common feature on all those bottoms was that the 1day RSI was oversold under the 30.00 level.   Consequently we regard this level as the last best buy opportunity for this year on the long term.   The other two rose by +113.71% and +97.62% respectively.   Buy and aim for a new rally on the minimum repeat of +97.62%, at 385.00.

My analysis of the price structure suggest there at least on possibility for that in the mid-term, although...   ... on Daily time-scale   until price stays below 479 and Aug highs   , I cannot rule out one more, potentially sharp and scary, move down to important mid-term support zone: 371-307 as per green count on the chart.   Under this scenario, the price needs to find support in this area and start building the bottom and the right side of the base/cup.   Alternatively, if price manages to consolidate above Sep low and create pivot around recent 476 highs, I would be eager to consider going long with price breaking above 479 with volume support.   Trading thesis:   until price respects 479 short-term resistance area, I would lean towards the short side, with any consecutive lower-low being a shorting opportunity (orange circle on a chart above as a potential example) with stops above recent high.   Although mid-term analysis shows potential for at least one more leg up, in the short term we are in no mans land, with both sides (long/short) having technical arguments to support itself. I would wait for the dust to settle and high quality, low risk set-up to emerge before taking any decisive stance.",

        "text": "In the intricate world of trading, price patterns are the footprints left by market sentiment. Understanding these patterns is like deciphering a complex code, revealing insights into potential market movements. Today we will explore 10 essential price patterns every trader should recognize. Each pattern is a chapter in the dynamic story of market behavior, offering opportunities to identify trends, reversals, and strategic entry or exit points.   1. Bull Flag:   The Flagbearer of Continuation   A Bull Flag is a continuation pattern, often seen in strong uptrends. It resembles a flagpole (the initial price spike) followed by a rectangular flag (consolidation phase). When the price breaks above the upper boundary of the flag, it signals a potential continuation of the uptrend.   2. Bear Flag:   The Bearish Counterpart   The Bear Flag is the opposite of the Bull Flag. It appears in downtrends, with a flagpole representing the initial price drop followed by a consolidation period. When the price breaches the lower boundary of the flag, it indicates a potential continuation of the downtrend.   3. Head and Shoulders:   The Classic Trend Reversal   The Head and Shoulders pattern is a powerful reversal indicator. It consists of three peaks  the central peak (head) is higher than the surrounding peaks (shoulders). When the price drops below the neckline (a line drawn through the lowest points of the shoulders), it suggests a potential trend reversal from bullish to bearish.   4. Inverse Head and Shoulders:   The Bullish Resurgence   The Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern is the bullish counterpart of the Head and Shoulders. It occurs after a downtrend and indicates a potential reversal to an uptrend. The pattern consists of three troughs  the central trough (head) is lower than the surrounding troughs (shoulders). When the price rises above the neckline, it signals a potential shift from bearish to bullish.   The cool thing about chat patterns is that they are everywhere. You often see many different chart patterns on a singular chart, or smaller patterns that are a part of a larger pattern. The tricky part is finding them and appropriately identifying them.   5. Double Top:   The Bearish Reversal Duo   A Double Top pattern occurs after an uptrend and signals a potential reversal. It consists of two peaks at nearly the same price level, indicating a struggle to push the price higher. When the price falls below the trough between the peaks, it suggests a possible shift from bullish to bearish.   6. Double Bottom:   The Bullish Reversal Duo   The Double Bottom is the bullish counterpart of the Double Top. It occurs after a downtrend and signals a potential reversal to an uptrend. It consists of two troughs at nearly the same price level, indicating a struggle to push the price lower. When the price rises above the peak between the troughs, it suggests a potential shift from bearish to bullish.   7. Rising Wedge:   The Rising Price Constrictor   A Rising Wedge is a bearish continuation or reversal pattern. It can form during a downtrend or in an uptrend where buying pressure becomes exhausted. The wedge is characterized by converging trend lines that slope upward. While the price may make higher highs and higher lows, the pattern tightens, indicating weakening momentum. When the price breaks below the lower trendline, it suggests a potential continuation of the downtrend or reversal of an uptrend.   Rising Wedge Reversal Example:   Rising Wedge Continuation Example:   8. Falling Wedge:   The Falling Price Constrictor   The Falling Wedge is the bullish counterpart of the Rising Wedge. It forms during an uptrend or a downtrend, characterized by converging trend lines that slope downward. While the price may make lower highs and lower lows, the pattern tightens, indicating weakening selling pressure. When the price breaks above the upper trendline, it suggests a potential continuation of the uptrend.   Falling Wedge Continuation Example:   Falling Wedge Reversal Example:   9. Symmetrical Triangle:   The Balance of Bulls and Bears   A Symmetrical Triangle is a neutral pattern that forms during a trend, indicating a period of consolidation. It is characterized by converging trend lines that slope in opposite directions. When the price breaks above the upper trendline, it signals a potential bullish move, and when it breaks below the lower trendline, it signals a potential bearish move.   10. Pennant:   The Brief Consolidation Pause   A Pennant is a continuation pattern that forms after a strong price movement. It resembles a small symmetrical triangle, indicating a brief consolidation before the previous trend resumes. When the price breaks above the upper boundary, it suggests a potential bullish continuation, and when it breaks below the lower boundary, it suggests a potential bearish continuation.   Important Thing To Consider:   Price patterns are a tool that if practiced and executed properly can be a great asset for any trader. There are a few things that all traders should keep in mind when using price patterns to make trading decisions.   Context is critical:   Price patterns don't exist in isolation; they occur within the context of larger market trends. It's essential to consider the prevailing market conditions, including the overall trend (bullish, bearish, or sideways), volume trends, and recent price action.   Confirmation is Key:   While recognizing a price pattern is an important skill, relying solely on its formation might lead to premature or false trades. Traders should always wait for confirmation signals before taking action. Confirmation can come in the form of a price breakout above a pattern's resistance level, a significant increase in trading volume confirming the pattern's direction, or additional technical indicators aligning with the pattern's signal. Waiting for confirmation helps traders filter out false signals, reducing the risk of entering trades based solely on pattern   Risk management is paramount:   No pattern, regardless of its historical accuracy, guarantees a profitable trade. Traders must always implement proper risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders and defining acceptable levels of risk per trade as a percentage of their trading capital. Risk management ensures that even if a trade based on a price pattern fails to materialize as expected, the impact on the trader's overall portfolio remains manageable.   Practice, practice, practice:   Identifying price patterns is a skill that improves with practice and experience. Traders should dedicate time to studying historical charts, both in live markets and during backtesting. Regularly practicing pattern charting enhances the ability to spot patterns quickly and accurately. TradingView offers a great set of tools to help anyone get started by offering a full line of automated pattern recognition indicators for educational and research use. Utilizing these automated pattern recognition indicators is a great way to visualize patterns in the real world as patterns are often less clean than textbook examples.   Recognizing these price patterns equips traders with a valuable skill set for navigating a dynamic market. However, it's vital to remember that patterns, like pieces of a puzzle, offer meaningful insights when combined with other indicators and thorough analysis. No single pattern guarantees profits, and each should be evaluated within the context of the broader market conditions. By integrating pattern recognition into a holistic trading strategy, traders can unlock the door to more informed, confident, and strategic trading decisions. Happy trading!   Ben with LeafAlgo",

Like the bars pattern and ghost feed. Does ghost feed account for volatility? A drawing of say, 5% change in the next 30 days would probably result in similar bars whether you're doing it on SPY,  TSLA, or MCD. And bars pattern doesn't draw past the live bar, so what are all these bars based on? They seem mostly higher than the actual price on that date...   Anyway, (rant over) we were looking for an upward deadcat bounce before heading to $415 and then Powell opened his mouth and everything was colored negatively. Good earnings have thus far seen their price gains erased and then some within days. (Mostly banks and a few large tech so far) So obviously we chose the opposite route, which was to dip unbelievably lower until the apocalypse was upon us. No but seriously, we've hit that $415 and now we're seeking our original target of $440, when the SPY was around $436 I believe.   And what's up with that forecast tool curve? It doesn't make lines from point A to point B that are in the least bit convincing. Pretty much I think it just slants at the speed of pi and if the price exceeds your target before the end of the line, it turns nice and green for you. Ugh, just ugh.   Anyway, it could dip lower and hit $413 (already did) and be on an extreme streak and go for $408 for no reason at all if it wanted to but its the end of the month and we've got 2 Fed meetings to go where we'll go absolutely bully when the result is 'nothing will happen', Santa Claus rally, and a look forward to Q1 when EPS is expected to bounce back -- they solved that UAW strike right?

You can enter long at the breakout of the falling wedge once we get it.   Entering long at 8 $ could be also a way as it's close to all time low that we saw in May 2023.   It would be also reasonable to buy at the downsloping support if the price goes so low.

The main A-B pattern, you know the one we have been tracking since the $299.29 high, it's   0.618 fib   is @ $225.67. This is a VERY strong fib line to say the least and any move above it will most likely be minimal and swift. Not to mention the two 1.0 fibs I have on there. That being said, I don't expect us to breach $228.21 at the 0.5 fib retracement or we are most likely dealing with something other than a wave iv. This isn't a rule but a strong guideline. Technically speaking we can rise all the way to $247.53 without invalidating this count as that would create overlap between waves ii & iv.   The MACD on the 3min timeframe, as of this writing, is on pos div. This doesn't mean it can't change with a further drop in price tomorrow. The 5 min looks poised to rise as well and the 15min is beginning to curl. These signify a move up of some proportion is coming. Price could make one more slight/quick low, adding to the pos div, and giving what I am calling micro c wave a little extra strength for the move up. I have a turquoise label showing we could make that OML I stated was very possible.   I also want to point out, when this whole move started up for this micro a wave, I called $207-$209 for the micro b wave. Tesla tried to shake us off her trail, but I believe she failed. If I am correct, we should start our trek up tomorrow for our micro c wave and finish out this wave iv of (3) of C either Thursday or Friday. There is always the chance wave v has started already, but with the choppiness/overlapping of this price action screams corrective.   Should price behave as I have said here, I will plan on buying some puts when it nears its top. If I get a wild hair, and Tesla has a clear and cut count, I may buy a couple calls for this micro c wave up. This is doubtful though as I just feel these types of trades are risky and generally for scraps. I would rather position myself better for the move down that has more meat. Of course, if I make any trades I will post them on here.   Leave a like and follow so you can help spread the word and maybe save someone some money.   Bonam Fortunam,   --Tyler",

The blue parallel channel starts from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. I need not mention what started a few weeks ago..   OPEC+ has already vowed to continue tightening output through the end of the year and if there are any embargos that take place on top of that, supply will be further compromised.   Cyclical realities:   Winter also creates demand since the cooler temperatures lead to increased use of oil byproducts.   Increased demand coupled with decreased supply leads to...   The white trend line from the pandemic low indicates that we are living out the reality of the trend. The price action is so faithful to that trendline, it's almost delicious to look at.   So what does this mean for me?   I wont reveal my exact play, but it's definitely not intra-day. (Some poetry for those that caught it)   I got a nice ITM call about a week ago which lost a bit of value since there was a correction, but since the expiry date is a few months out, I think it will produce some juicy, fat profits once time begins to tell all.   Since OXY should follow the trend of oil prices and since it is a domestic company that would contribute to the replenishment of the SPR if the U.S. decides to go that way, I think OXY is a nice portfolio addition/ swing trade opportunity.   The regression trend since the beginning of the war in Ukraine is flat which indicates that we are in a consolidation channel that has not truly broken out to the upside yet.   The pandemic low trendline is perfectly overlapping with the parallel channel that I drew beginning on the Ukraine invasion date. This indicates to me that we are trending up up and away but are due to see a catalyst for this true breakout.   Either a news event (like earnings or geopolitics) with cause a sharp breakout or we will melt up along the trendline.   Let me know what you think!",

No. In April 2020 I posted the same chart with the words   \"#MMT Everything\"   Gov't Free money backstopped the risk to investors fueling a massive Stock Market Rally and Inflation.   Euphoria on Steroids.   Most made the mistake of reading market Euphoria as evidence that markets have superior knowledge and can predict future trends.   Permabulls and \"Buy the dippers\" felt vindicated that their strategy always works. Then 2022 came along and reality   changed their false perception.   Personally, I was highly doubtful of the 34-day bear market during the worst economic crisis since 1929. Despite facing criticism for my defiance,   I continued to hold my skeptical stance throughout the entire period of market growth. Even when the market reached its peak, I went short   and repeatedly warned others of the potential for a market downturn. However, my caution was met with ridicule and disbelief.   As a testament to my skepticism, I would like to share a video from January 21, 2022, which captures my thoughts and concerns during that time.   17:34   Every time there was a bear market rally, the permabulls and those who subscribed to the \"buy the dip\" strategy would tell me that I was mistaken.   They would argue that \"markets don't care about economics.\" Even today, I still hear similar statements. This persistent presence of permabulls and   buy-the-dippers, eager to return to the era of government-backed investment risk, is a warning sign for me that the market has not yet reached its bottom.   It suggests that some investors are still too optimistic and may not fully understand the complexities and risks involved in the stock market.   In light of this, it is important to approach investment decisions with caution, carefully considering a variety of factors and indicators, rather than   relying on market euphoria or past performance as an indicator of future success.   I am very well aware that I risk being a permabear or at least being perceived that way by missing \"the bottom.\" The truth is I am not concerned about   a bottom. I am concerned that my dynamic analysis of macroeconomics and charting gives me the green light that the worse is behind us. If it happens   to coincide with a bottom great! If not, so be it. I am only concerned with making money not being right and picking bottoms.   I leave you with this video from Feb 2022",

        "text": "SoFi Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: SOFI) has been one of this years best-performing stocks with its stock up more than 77% YTD  outperforming the market in the process. While the stock is down 8.6% since our last article covering it, it may be poised to rebound soon as its Q3 earnings are set to come out pre-market on October 30th. Analysts expect the Fintech to report net revenues of $511.6 million as well as an EPS of -$0.077. However, the digital bank may shatter these estimates, which is a tradition for it considering that it beat estimates in its last 9 earnings. In addition, student loan repayments resumed this month, and given that the company dominates the student loan refinancing market with a 60% market share, its expectations of turning a profit in Q4 seem to be realistic. In light of this, taking a long position in SOFI stock may prove to be profitable.   SOFI Fundamentals   Q3 Forecast   Last June, we expected SoFi to surprise investors by reaching profitability sooner than managements expectation of Q4, however, that was before the company posted its Q2 earnings report. While the Q2 earnings were generally positive, they led us to revise our stance since management shared in the Q2 earnings call that SBC as well as depreciation and amortization expenses will increase in the second half of the year.   Although were projecting SoFi to report a net loss in its upcoming Q3 earnings, analyst estimates may be too low for the company. First, analysts forecast the fintech to report $511.6 million in Q3 revenues which might be a low figure.   SoFi has been adding members at an impressive rate so far, with Q2 witnessing a record increase of 584 thousand new members. This increase could be due to the digital bank attracting a large portion of customers migrating from regional banks following the banking crisis earlier this year or customers looking to refinance their student loans ahead of repayments resumption as we covered in 2 previous articles.   That being said, there is a strong correlation between SoFis revenue and customers with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.982.   We can get an estimate of SoFis member number by taking the average of new members added for the past four quarters. That would see the digital bank adding around 480 thousand new members in Q3 2023, making its total members more than 6.7 million.   According to the graph above, at 6.7 million members, SoFi could report $523.1 million in revenue which is more than analysts estimate of $511.6 million. That said, these figures may differ if it adds customers at the same pace as Q2 due to attracting customers looking to refinance their student debt or migrating from traditional banks.   Moving on to non-interest expenses, we can a projection based on each item as a percentage of revenue. The first expense is technology and product development. This expense represented between 24%  26% of SoFis revenue for the past 4 quarters, which means that it averages around 25.29% of its revenue. Therefore, Q3s forecasted technology and product development expenses should be $132.3 million, according to the projections.   Using the same method, we can forecast SoFis sales and marketing expenses, operations expenses, as well as G&A expenses. In this way, these expenses are projected to be $196.2 million, $96.6 million, and $140 million, respectively.   Moreover, SoFi recognizes provisions for credit loss as part of its non-interest expense. Over the past 4 quarters, this expense averaged $13 million which is the number we are taking into consideration when forecasting the digital banks Q3 non-interest expense. Adding all of these expenses, SoFis forecasted non-interest expense is $578.2 million in Q3.   These figures are consistent with management expectations in the Q2 earnings call as sales and marketing costs, operations costs, and G&A costs represent a smaller percentage of revenue compared to Q3 2022.   Now, only income tax remains to calculate SoFis Q3 EPS. In the first half of the year, the fintech reported $1.6 million and $1.7 million as an income tax benefit. The company shared in its Q2 earnings report that it doesnt expect any other significant increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. Accordingly,  we can the average number to forecast Q3s income tax benefit which is $1.7 million.   Quarter\tIncome Tax   Q1 23\t$1,637,000   Q2 23\t$1,780,000   Q3 23\t$1,708,500   Based on these figures, we can project SoFis Q3 net loss to be around $53.4 million or an EPS of -$0.056 which represents a beat against analyst estimates of -$0.077.   Net Revenue\t$523,116,864   Tech & Prod Dev\t$132,319,238   Sales & Marketing\t$196,275,579   Cost of Operations\t$96,608,021   G&A\t$140,017,955   Provision for CL\t$13,072,500   Loss Before Income Tax\t-$55,176,429   Income Tax Benefit\t$1,708,500   Net Loss\t-$53,467,929   OS\t950,114,369   EPS\t-$0.056   Student Loan Payments Resumption   The resumption of student loan repayments is the biggest catalyst for SoFi as it will be a major factor in the fintech reaching profitability in Q4. Some analysts expect the resumption of student loan repayments will only have an incremental impact on student loan lenders due to the current high interest rates.   The appeal of federal student loans is that they are eligible for mass debt forgiveness plans such as the one struck down by the Supreme Court recently. Currently, the Department of Education is attempting to cancel large amounts of debt for a second time through the Higher Education Act. This plan may not be in full effect before the 2024 elections, and even if it is, it is expected to witness legal challenges to prevent it from being implemented. However, if the plan is successful, those refinancing with private lenders like SoFi wont have any of their debt forgiven.   That said, SoFis members may find its refinancing offers compelling since its student loan borrowers weighted average income is $163 thousand with a weighted average FICO score of 768. These members have excellent credit which allows them to find offers with a low interest rate. Therefore, those borrowers may find SoFis offering attractive to extend the term of their loans and lower their monthly payments.   As is, the interest rate on federal student loans this year is 5.5% for undergraduate loans, 7.05% for graduates, and 8.05% for professional students or parents of students. Meanwhile, SoFis repayment APR ranges from 5.24% to 9.95% for fixed-rate loans, and starts from 6.24% for variable-rate loans, with the maximum APR capped at 13.95%. It is worth noting that borrowers with better credit scores pay a lower APR, which comprises most of SoFis members.   SoFi is also attempting to make its offering more attractive as it is offering a 0.25% autopay interest rate reduction which requires borrowers to make their scheduled monthly payments by an automatic monthly deduction from a savings or a checking account. This discount will reduce interest each month and more of the monthly payments will be applied to the principal loan balance  allowing borrowers to pay off their loan faster. If this offer gains traction among borrowers, SoFis member growth could be at the same pace as Q2 in the coming quarters.   Risks   The biggest risk facing SoFi is the delinquency rates of its customers as delinquency rates have been growing since the beginning of the year and are approaching pre-pandemic levels at 2.36%, according to the latest data from the Fed. That said, SoFis delinquency rates remain healthy as 90-day personal loan delinquencies were 0.4% in Q2, according to the Q2 earnings call. Meanwhile, its annualized personal loan charge-off rate was 2.94%, which is lower than the assumed weighted average default rates in its fair value model of 4.6%.   Another risk facing SoFi is its declining revenue per member which has been dropping sequentially since Q3 2022. According to the aforementioned members and revenue projections for the fintechs Q3 earnings, its revenue per member is forecasted to be $77.84, which would represent a 2.4% decline QoQ. While this decline could be attributed to the macro environment of high-interest rates, this trend could lead to SoFis revenues stagnating in the future.   Quarter\tMembers\tRevenue\tQoQ Growth\tRev/Member   Q3 22\t4,743,000\t$423,985,000\t424,000\t$89.39   Q4 22\t5,223,000\t$456,679,000\t480,000\t$87.44   Q1 23\t5,656,000\t$472,158,000\t433,000\t$83.48   Q2 23\t6,240,000\t$498,018,000\t584,000\t$79.81   Q3 23\t6,720,250\t$523,116,864\t480,250\t$77.84   Technical Analysis   On the hourly chart, SOFI stock is trading in a bearish trend as it is in a downward channel below the 200, 50, and 21 MAs. However, the RSI is approaching oversold at 35 and the MACD is approaching a bullish crossover which are bullish signs.   With its Q3 earnings right around the corner on October 30th, SOFI stock could be a good investment at current levels given its history of parabolic runs following its earnings. As is, the aforementioned model expects the fintech to beat analysts estimates for revenue and EPS ahead of reaching profitability for the first time in Q4, per managements expectations.   SOFI Forecast   With the fintechs Q3 earnings coming up next week, SOFI stock could be an opportunity at current levels as it may beat analysts revenue and EPS estimates, based on our model. With that in mind, the company can beat our projections if its members grow at a similar pace to Q2 where it witnessed a record 584 thousand new members. Meanwhile, the resumption of student loan repayments is a major catalyst for the digital bank since it could help it achieve its target of becoming profitable in Q4. Given the quality of SoFis members, a large number of borrowers may refinance their student loans with SoFi, especially with its 0.25% autopay interest rate reduction that makes its offering more compelling.",

The first pattern on todays chart is the rising trendline along the lows of December, March, August and September. Prices have pushed back toward this support, which may suggest its getting ready to break.   Next is the falling resistance that began in mid-September. This creates a triangle when combined with the rising trendline, which is a potential reversal pattern.   Third, MU rallied above its Tuesday high on Wednesday before rolling over. The result was a bearish outside day -- another potential reversal pattern.   Fourth, the outside candle spanned the 50- and 100-day simple moving average (SMAs). It also touched the 8- and 21-day exponential moving average (EMAs). That may suggest its become neutral over multiple time frames. Could a new direction begin?

Those covid bucks did everyone pretty good huh?!   But if you look around, every company little by little has been taking back all those Covid gains and the investor has been the one paying the price.   HTZ went public Oct.20 and went sideways until Apr.21   Price broke out of sideways range May21. The sideways range was then deemed an Accumulation stage.   From there, it went into Uptrend that took price from 2.00 to topping out at around 46.00   The uptrend came to an end Nov.21.   Since end of Uptrend, price has entered a sideways range seeing price make a series of Lower Highs into Support area at 16.35. We now have a Descending Triangle pattern.   These Lower highs display the strength of the seller pressure preventing price from making a higher high. Support area of 16.35 is getting weaker with every touch and with the seller pressure getting stronger, price should break thru support shortly.   You dont find too many stocks that havent entered a downtrend or given up some of the covid gains by now.   In terms of trend trading, HTZ looks like a tree that has come to full fruition, but it has yet to be harvested.   I typically would not enter a trade this close to support level but closer to the resistance trendline created by lower high.   However, the support area at around 16.35 has been weaken and the seller pressure is getting stronger and Support should be broken soon. For this reason, I will be entering trade short now.

Revenue amounted to 34.15 billion USD (a relative increase of 23%), and net profit reached 11.58 billion USD (a relative increase of 164%).   The main reasons for such outstanding results were the increase in demand for advertising and the reduction in costs for the development of artificial intelligence technologies. If we take as a basis the analysts' forecast of 13.06% for META's revenue growth in the next four quarters, then relative to the P/S (capitalisation/revenue) multiplier, the fair price of the company's shares could reach 491.70 USD.   Therefore, today, we focus on the Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) stock chart.   On the D1 timeframe, support has formed at 299.50, with resistance at 328.84. META's shares are becoming cheaper due to a negative market background. However, if quotes consolidate above 306.47, the trend may change.   On the H1 timeframe, after the level at 301.56 is broken through, there is a chance that the new upward movement starts. In the medium term, the target for the price increase can be around 328.84.

        "text": "The Butterfly pattern is a reversal pattern composed of four legs, marked X-A, A-B, B-C and C-D.   It helps you identify when a current price move is likely approaching its end. This means you can enter the market as the price reverses direction.   The above chart is a bearish version of the pattern, where you would be look to sell AMZN after the pattern has completed.   X-A   In its bearish version, the first leg forms when the price falls sharply from point X to point A.   A-B   The A-B leg then sees the price change direction and retrace 78.6% of the distance covered by the X-A leg.   The Butterfly is similar to the Gartley and Bat patterns but the final C-D leg makes a 127% extension of the initial X-A leg, rather than a retracement of it.   B-C   In the B-C leg, the price changes direction again and moves back down, retracing 38.2% to 88.6% of the distance covered by the A-B leg.   C-D   The C-D leg is the final and most important part of the pattern. As with the Gartley and Bat pattern you should also have an AB=CD structure to complete the pattern, however the C-D leg very often extends forming a 127% or 161.8% extension of the A-B leg. As a trader you would be looking to enter at point D of the pattern.   How to trade a bearish Butterfly   To trade a bearish Butterfly pattern, place your sell order at point D (the 127% Fibonacci extension of the X-A leg), position your stop loss just above the 161.8% extension of the X-A leg and place your profit target at either point A (aggressive) or point B (conservative).",

Governments issue bonds when they want to borrow money. Bonds issued by the US government are called Treasurys. If you buy a bond, you're giving them a loan. The bond itself functions as an IOU note, with the holder entitled to regular interest payments and repayment of the loan in full at a later date.   Over the past 18 months, FOMC has raised benchmark interest rates by more than 500 basis points  the steepest increase since the 1980s. In recent months, the central bank has signaled it plans to keep rates high well into 2024 until its 2% inflation target. Remember, yields move in the opposite direction to bond prices. When borrowing costs go up, bond prices fall because their fixed returns become less attractive to investors.

RTX stock spiked on Tuesday after a Q3 earnings beat.   Rapidly evolving circumstances in Israel and Palestine sparked greater interest in defense companies going into the earnings season.   Northrop Grumman specializes in advanced missiles, missile components, defense systems and sensor technology. The company's various manned aircraft include the A-10 Thunderbolt, B-2 Stealth Bomber, B-21 Raider, F-35 and the F/A-18 Super Hornet.   Northrop's third-quarter earnings rose about 5% to $6.18 per share on 9% revenue growth to $9.78 billion.   We expect Northrop earnings to fall for the first time in three quarters, sliding 1.4% to $5.81 per share. Revenue views targeted a 6.8% rise to $9.58 billion.   The company reported that defense system sales rose 6% to $1.42 billion and mission systems revenue increased 7% to $2.63 billion. Northrop's space systems division reported an 11% revenue increase to $3.5 billion. Aeronautics revenue rose 9% to $2.77 billion.   It lifted its full-year sales guidance to $39 billion, from the previous range of $38.4 billion to $38.8 billion. Northrop maintained its earnings forecast, expecting EPS between $22.45 and $22.85.   Analysts polled by FactSet see full-year earnings of $22.74 on $38.79 billion in revenue.   Northrop is well positioned thanks to its \"high priority\" long-term growth programs including the B-21 and Sentential Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD), an intercontinental ballistic missile system, UBS wrote in an Oct. 10 research note. The programs provide greater visibility and should drive overperformance. UBS initiated coverage of NOC stock with a buy rating and $555 price target.   NOC stock gained 0.6% early Thursday, adding to Wednesday's 1% gain. Shares slid below their 10-day moving average early in the week.

Revenue: actual = USD 34.15 billion, expectations = USD 33.56 billion    Number of daily active users: fact = 2.09 billion, expectation = 2.07 billion according to StreetAccount.   META's share price initially rose in post-market trading but then reversed course and fell more than 3% following cautionary comments from CFO Susan Lee about the impact of military conflict in the Middle East on the advertising market.   Thus, the META stock price may have received a bullish boost from the psychological level of USD 300, but it is possible that it will receive a bearish one because the opening price on Thursday could be around USD 290.   In the analysis of the META share price on October 3, we paid attention to the candle from July 27, when the high of the year was formed  then, extremely high volumes were recorded on the NASDAQ exchange. They can be interpreted as the desire of large players to fix profits from long positions.   Since then, the price has updated its high of the year around the USD 325 level, but this update turned into a classic bear trap. Thus, a large-scale double top pattern has formed on the chart, which will most likely lead to a bearish breakout of the ascending channel (shown in blue).   When a breakout occurs, a gap will likely form, which can serve as resistance. The bulls may be given hope by the level of USD 175 per share, which previously supported META shares.

        "text": "UPDATE: The image I embedded in the TV chart for this idea was somehow rejected on the post. So I posted it on   Imgur   instead.   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   The chart I present for this idea doesn't look like a normal TradingView chart. The reason is that this is not a trade, based on chart technicals, but an investment, which I intend to hold for years. So, I don't care quite so much whether the stock wiggles upward or downward or sideways over the next two weeks. If you're looking for a trade, stop reading now. This idea is not for you.   If you're still reading, you're waiting for an explanation of the above chart. I I'll get to that, but first I want to step back a bit further.   I spent the last week looking through US-listed insurance companies for a candidate to invest for the long haul.   Why?   First: Real yields are at 2.5%, a level not seen since the GFC. This favors owning low-risk bond portfolios -- the kind insurance companies have. Both   AFG   and   CINF   have about $1.50 in investments for every dollar in market cap.   Second: As rates plateau, the AOCI losses that depress the tangible equity of insurance companies can gradually reverse, becoming a value creation tailwind. AOCI is 6% of   CINF   's tangible BV, and 14% of   AFG   's.  This is very modest. Other insurance companies ($LNC...) ignored duration risk and had their portfolio bludgeoned half to death. From a short-term point of view, that makes   LNC   perversely intriguing. If that stock survives its could get quite the bounce. But owning insurance stock shouldn't be a thrilling experience.   Third: Insurers are raking in big rate increases as they reprice catastrophe risks, inflation, and \"social inflation\". Florida homeowners know what I'm talking about.   And lastly:   CINF   has a beta of 0.65,   AFG   has a beta of 0.8. In other words these are \"defensive\" stocks, unlike banks, say. In uncertain times, insurers may suffer less than other industries. Though, the record is a bit uneven on that: During the dotcom crash they did well, in the GFC and pandemic, not so much.   So, to finally get to the chart: What even is the Tangible Value Creation Ratio? It's a modification of a key metric that   CINF   uses to manage their business. Here's   their definition   :   Value Creation Ratio means the total of 1) rate of growth in book value per share plus 2) the ratio of dividends declared per share to beginning book value per share.   I prefer   tangible   book value to book value, so that's what I use. But that quibble aside, I really like this metric: It captures what I am truly interested in as an investor: Dividends and growth in the value of common shareholder's tangible equity. And the ratio also doesn't penalize companies for their choices with respect to dividend policy, capital structure, stock splits, and so on. It simply holds management responsible for the outcome to common shareholders. So, I calculate that ratio on a quarterly basis, aggregate it over multi-period spans and then annualize it. I think this ratio is particularly suited for a long-term analysis, since there's a certain variability in the short term, due to catastrophe losses and/or rate fluctiations. I actually did create the chart for a full 20-year span. If anyone wants to see it, let me know. But   CINF   's executive team came on in 2011, and it seems that the performance of the company has improved substantially since then.   Obviously, Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest insurer in the group. And based on this chart it looks very fairly priced for its excellent long-term performance. So why don't I want it? It's not that I don't trust Buffett & Munger, or their eventual replacements. I am more concerned about investors' reaction to these legends passing the baton. Whenever and however that might happen. To me, this just seems like a big event risk. As for   PGR   , I'd love to own it, if it ever comes back from the valuation stratosphere.   RLI   also seems like a very well-run insurer. But the slight edge in long-term performance doesn't seem to justify the huge bump in valuation.   A word about my data: I calculated these metrics programmatically, using financial statements downloaded from public sources. I did verify some of the data and calculations, but the testing is limited at this point. If anyone wants to compare notes, I am happy to.   As a last note:   CINF   will report earnings after the close today. (Thursday, 2023-10-26). I bought some yesterday. But I doubt that the stock will jump in a meaningful way after earnings, even if they turn out to be brilliant. This thesis will likely take several years to play out one way or the other.",

        "text": "Shares of GOOG and GOOGL fell about 9.5% on Wednesday, wiping Google's parent company's market value by USD 166.64 billion, the fifth-largest decline in capitalization history, according to Dow Jones Market Data.   It is noteworthy that the drop occurred as a result of the publication of a report that turned out to be better than expected:    earnings per share: actual = USD 1.55, forecast = USD 1.45;    gross income: actual = USD 76.69 billion; forecast = USD 75.95.   Why did Google's stock price collapse? Among the reasons may be the fact that revenue from cloud-based services has shown a decline. It amounted to USD 8.41 billion, which is about 2% below expectations of USD 8.6 billion, although in the same quarter last year it was equal to USD 6.87 billion, that is, an increase of 22% over the year.   However, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said the stock's negative reaction was \"overblown.\" And according to analysts at Mizuho Americas, the decline in cloud revenue will be \"temporary,\" based on what they've seen in rival Amazon's cloud business.   If the price decline continues, how deep can it be?   From a technical analysis perspective, there has been a bearish breakout of the contracting triangle (bearish wedge pattern, shown in blue lines). Having estimated the width of the wedge at points A and B, approximately = USD 126 - USD 106 = USD 20, we can plot this distance down from the breakout point C to get a guideline for point D = USD 134 - USD 20 = USD 114. That is, presumably, the price is aimed at the May gap zone.   However, to reach this level, the bears will have to overcome support around the USD 126 level, where the price now lies, having found support during yesterday's history-making decline. This support comes from a line (shown as a dotted line) parallel to the upper boundary of the bearish wedge, as well as from the $126 horizontal, which has interacted significantly with the stock price in the past. It is possible that the bears will be helped by a negative political and geopolitical background.   This article represents the opinion of the Companies operating under the FXOpen brand only.

Reason beeing its a former, engulfed supply zone that stopped the previous uptrend before beeing taken out. It also served as Support for a short period of time.   In general if this trade should work out i see other major stocks going down.   S-L (Stop- Loss):   I dont want to see a close of a weekly candle above the green line.   Target:   A former resistance area that is in confluence with the 50% of the range of the recent uptrend.   Additional: The last uptrend swing of Tesla (See blue Fib levels) followed a correction to the 23% Fib before starting with the current uptrend. The 23% Fib of the current uptrend is marked with a green rectangle.   Good luck   Disclaimer:   - This information does not constitute as financial advice and is only for educational purposes.
